398960	From  http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Business+Fundamentals  The  facts  that  affect  a  company's      underlying  value.  Examples  of  business      fundamentals  include  debt,  cash  flow,      supply  of  and  demand  for  the  company's      products,  and  so  forth.  For  instance,      if  a  company  does  not  have  a      sufficient  supply  of  products,  it  will      fail.  Likewise,  demand  for  the  product      must  remain  at  a  certain  level  in      order  for  it  to  be  successful.  Strong      business  fundamentals  are  considered      essential  for  long-term  success  and      stability.  See  also:  Value  Investing,      Fundamental  Analysis.  For  a  stock  the  basic  fundamentals  are  the  second  column  of  numbers  you  see  on  the  google  finance  summary  page,    P/E  ratio,  div/yeild,  EPS,  shares,  beta.      For  the  company  itself  it's  generally  the  stuff  on  the  'financials'  link    (e.g.  things  in  the  quarterly  and  annual  report,    debt,  liabilities,  assets,  earnings,  profit  etc.
19183	If  your  sole  proprietorship  losses  exceed  all  other  sources  of  taxable  income,  then  you  have  what's  called  a  Net  Operating  Loss  (NOL).  You  will  have  the  option  to  "carry  back"  and  amend  a  return  you  filed  in  the  last  2  years  where  you  owed  tax,  or  you  can  "carry  forward"  the  losses  and  decrease  your  taxes  in  a  future  year,  up  to  20  years  in  the  future.  For  more  information  see  the  IRS  links  for  NOL.  Note:  it's  important  to  make  sure  you  file  the  NOL  correctly  so  I'd  advise  speaking  with  an  accountant.  (Especially  if  the  loss  is  greater  than  the  cost  of  the  accountant...)
327002	To  be  deductible,  a  business  expense  must  be  both  ordinary  and  necessary.  An  ordinary  expense  is  one  that  is  common  and  accepted  in  your  trade  or  business.  A  necessary  expense  is  one  that  is  helpful  and  appropriate  for  your  trade  or  business.  An  expense  does  not  have  to  be  indispensable  to  be  considered  necessary.    (IRS,  Deducting  Business  Expenses)  It  seems  to  me  you'd  have  a  hard  time  convincing  an  auditor  that  this  is  the  case.    Since  business  don't  commonly  own  cars  for  the  sole  purpose  of  housing  $25  computers,  you'd  have  trouble  with  the  "ordinary"  test.    And  since  there  are  lots  of  other  ways  to  house  a  computer  other  than  a  car,  "necessary"  seems  problematic  also.
451207	What  about  web-hosting  fees?  Cost  of  Internet  service?  Cost  of  computer  equipment  to  do  the  work?  Amortized  cost  of  development?  Time  for  support  calls/email?  Phone  service  used  for  sales?  Advertising/marketing  expenses?  Look  hard--I  bet  there  are  some  costs.
263485	IRS  pub  521  has  all  the  information  you  need.  Expenses  reimbursed.  If  you  are  reimbursed  for  your  expenses  and  you      use  the  cash  method  of  accounting,  you  can  deduct  your  expenses  either      in  the  year  you  paid  them  or  in  the  year  you  received  the      reimbursement.  If  you  use  the  cash  method  of  accounting,  you  can      choose  to  deduct  the  expenses  in  the  year  you  are  reimbursed  even      though  you  paid  the  expenses  in  a  different  year.  See  Choosing  when  to      deduct,  next.  If  you  deduct  your  expenses  and  you  receive  the      reimbursement  in  a  later  year,  you  must  include  the  reimbursement  in      your  income  on  Form  1040,  line  21  This  is  not  unusual.  Anybody  who  moves  near  the  end  of  the  year  can  have  this  problem.  The  39  week  time  test  also  can  be  an  issue  that  span  over  2  tax  years.  I  would  take  the  deduction  for  the  expenses  as  soon  a  I  could,  and  then  count  the  income  in  the  later  year  if  they  pay  me  back.  IF  they  do  so  before  April  15th,  then  I  would  put  them  on  the  same  tax  form  to  make  things  easier.
218858	I  believe  moving  reimbursement  has  to  be  counted  as  income  no  matter  when  you  get  it.  I'd  just  put  it  under  miscellaneous  income  with  an  explanation.
466037	You  are  describing  a  corporation.    You  can  set  up  a  corporation  to  perform  business,  but  if  you  were  using  the  money  for  any  personal  reasons  the  courts  could  Pierce  the  corporate  veil  and  hold  you  personally  liable.    Also,  setting  up  a  corporation  for  purely  personal  reasons  is  fraud.
281500	The  tax  is  depended  upon  state  where  you  are  registered  and  the  salary  paid.  More  here    If  you  employ  contract  you  need  not  pay  tax.
269447	Credit  unions  are  mutually-owned  (i.e.  customer  owned)  financial  institutions  that  provide  banking  services.    They  take  deposits  from  their  members  (customers)  and  loan  them  to  other  members.    Members  vote  on  a  board  of  directors  who  manage  operations.      They  are  considered  not-for-profit,  but  they  pay  interest  on  deposits.    They  get  some  preferential  tax  treatment  and  regulation  and  their  deposits  are  insured  by  a  separate  organization  if  federally  accredited.    State-chartered  credit  unions  don't  have  to  maintain  deposit  insurance  at  all.      Their  charters  specify  who  can  join.    They  can  be  regionally  based,  employer  based,  or  based  on  some  other  group  with  common  interests.    Regulators  restrict  them  so  that  they  don't  interfere  too  much  with  banks.    Otherwise  their  preferential  tax  and  regulatory  treatment  would  leave  banks  uncompetitive.      Other  organizations  with  similar  limits  have  gone  on  to  be  competitive  when  the  limits  were  released.    For  example,  there  used  to  be  an  insurance  company  just  for  government  employees,  the  Government  Employees  Insurance  Company.    You  may  know  it  better  as  GEICO  (yes,  the  one  with  the  gecko  advertisements).    Now  they  offer  life  and  auto  insurance  all  over.      Credit  unions  would  like  looser  limitations  (or  no  limitations  at  all),  but  not  enough  to  give  up  their  preferential  tax  treatment.    Banks  oppose  looser  limitations  and  have  as  much  political  clout  as  credit  unions.
155634	It's  required  by  law.    12  USC  1759  (b)  requires  that  membership  in  a  credit  union  be  limited  to  one  or  more  groups  with  a  "common  bond",  or  to  people  within  a  particular  geographic  area.  For  lots  more  gory  details  on  how  this  is  interpreted  and  enforced,  you  can  read  the  manual  given  to  credit  unions  by  the  National  Credit  Union  Administration,  which  is  their  regulatory  agency.
498631	Do  I  need  an  Investment  Adviser?    No,  but  you  may  want  to  explore  the  idea  of  having  one.  Is  he  going  to  tell  me  anything  that  my  accountant  can't?    Probably.  How  much  expertise  are  you  expecting  from  your  accountant  here?  Do  you  think  your  accountant  knows  everything  within  the  realms  of  money  from  taxes,  insurance  products,  investments  and  all  your  choices  and  what  would  work  or  wouldn't?  Seems  like  it  could  be  a  tall  order  to  my  mind.  My  accountant  did  say  to  come  to  him  for  advice  on  investment/business      issues.  So,  he  is  willing,  but  is  he  able?  Not  asking  about  his      competence,  but  rather  "is  there  something  that  only  an  Investment      Adviser  can  provide,  by  law,  that  an  accountant  can't"?  Not  that  I  know  though  don't  forget  how  much  expertise  are  you  expecting  here  from  one  person.  Is  this  person  intended  to  answer  all  your  money  questions?  But  isn't  that  something  that  my  accountant  could/should  do?  Perhaps  though  how  well  are  you  expecting  one  person  to  be  aware  of  so  much  stuff?  I  want  you  to  know  all  the  tax  law  so  I  can  minimize  taxes,  maximize  my  investment  returns,  cover  me  with  adequate  insurance,  and  protect  my  savings  seems  like  a  bit  much  to  put  on  one  entity.  Do  I  need  either  of  them?  Won't  the  Internet  and  sites  like  this  one      suffice?  Need  no.  However,  how  much  time  are  you  prepared  to  spend  learning  the  basics  of  strategies  that  work  for  you?  How  much  money  are  you  prepared  to  put  into  things  to  learn  what  works  and  doesn't?  While  it  is  your  decision,  consider  how  to  what  extent  do  you  diagnose  your  medical  issues  through  the  internet  versus  going  to  see  a  doctor?  Be  careful  of  how  much  of  a  do  it  yourself  approach  you  want  to  go  here  and  recognize  that  there  are  multiple  approaches  that  may  work.  The  question  is  which  trade-offs  are  OK  for  you.
549435	An  accountant  should  be  able  to  advise  on  the  tax  consequences  of  different  classes  of  investments/assets/debts  (e.g.  RRSP,  TFSA,  mortgage).  But  I  would  not  ask  an  accountant  which  specific  securities  to  hold  in  these  vehicles,  or  what  asset  allocation  (in  terms  of  geography,  capitalization,  or  class  (equity  vs  fixed  income  vs  derivatives  vs  structured  notes  etc).  An  investment  advisor  would  be  better  suited  to  matching  your  investments  to  your  risk  tolerance.
181678	I  think  the  OP  is  getting  lost  in  designations.    Sounds  to  me  that  what  he  wants  is  a  'financial  advisor'  not  an  'investment  advisor'.    Does  he  even  have  investments?    Does  he  want  to  be  told  which  securities  to  buy?      Or  is  he  wanting  advice  on  overall  savings,  insurance,  tax-shelters,  retirement  planning,  mortgages,  etc.    Which  is  a  different  set  of  skills  -  the  financial  advisor  skill  set.  Accountants  don't  have  that  skill  set.    They  know  operating  business  reporting,  taxes  and  generally  how  to  keep  it  healthy  and  growing.    They  can  do  personal  tax  returns  (as  a  favour  to  only  the  owners  of  the  business  they  keep  track  of  usually).  IMO  they  can  deal  with  the  reporting  but  not  the  planning  or  optimization.  But  IMO  the  OP  should  just  read  up  and  learn  this  stuff  for  himself.    Accreditation  mean  nothing.    Eg.    the  major  'planner'  brand  teaches  factually  wrong  stuff  about  RRSPs  -  which  are  the  backbone  of  Canadian's  finances.
362069	The  short  answer  is  yes  you  can,  but  you  have  to  make  sure  you  do  it  correctly.    If  you  are  employed  by  a  tech  company  that  does  contract  work  at  a  separate  location  and  you  don't  get  reimbursed  by  your  employer  for  travel  expenses,  you  can  claim  the  mileage  between  your  home  and  location  B  as  a  business  expense,  but  there's  a  catch  -  you  have  to  subtract  the  mileage  between  your  home  and  location  A  (your  employer).  So  if  it's  20  miles  from  your  house  to  your  employer  (location  A),  and  30  miles  from  your  house  to  the  business  you're  contracting  at  (location  B),  you  can  only  claim  10  miles  each  way  (so  20  miles  total).  Obviously  if  the  distance  to  location  B  is  closer  than  your  employer  (location  A),  you're  out  of  luck.  You  will  have  to  itemize  to  take  this  deduction,  by  filling  out  a  Schedule  A  for  itemized  deductions  and  Form  2106  to  calculate  how  much  of  a  deduction  for  travel  expenses  you  can  take.  Google  "should  i  itemize",  if  you're  unsure  whether  to  take  the  Standard  Deduction  or  Itemize.  Sources:
324921	Tax  Deducted  at  source  is  applicable  to  Employee  /  Employer  [contract  employee]  relations  ...  it  was  also  made  applicable  for  cases  where  an  Indian  company  pays  for  software  products  [like  MS  Word  etc]  as  the  product  is  not  sold,  but  is  licensed  and  is  treated  as  Royalty  [unlike  sale  of  a  consumer  product,  that  you  have,  say  car]  ...  Hence  it  depends  on  how  your  contract  is  worded  with  your  India  clients,  best  is  have  it  as  a  service  agreement.  Although  services  are  also  taxed,  however  your  contract  should  clearly  specify  that  any  tax  in  India  would  be  borne  by  your  Indian  Client  ...

274188	I  am  an  Israeli  based  citizen  who  represents  and  Indian  company  who  sells  its  products  in  Israel.  As  an  agent  I  am  entitled  to  commission  on  sales  on  behalf  the  Indian  company  who  advised  that.  Any  commission  paid  to  you  will  be  applicable  to  TDS  at  20.9%  of  the  commission  amount,  the  tax  will  be  paid  and  a  Tax  paid  certificate  will  be  given  to  you.      According  to  a  Bilateral  Double  tax  avoidance  treaty  if  the  tax  has  been  deducted  in  India  you  will  get  credit  for  this  tax  in  Israel.
504419	For  sure  you  should  get  a  lawyer  on  this  one,  but  it  would  seem  to  me  that  the  simplest  path  forward  would  be  to  convert  the  business  to  a  partnership  where  both  spouses  are  owners,  and  to  write  a  clause  into  the  partnership  agreement  stipulating  what  happens  upon  death  of  a  partner.    Such  an  approach  really  should  be  done  with  a  lawyer  to  make  sure  that  it's  all  legally  sound  and  will  stand  up  in  court  if  needed.
108052	Have  you  tried  others  on  Wikipedia's  list?
89503	You  really  shouldn't  be  using  class  tracking  to  keep  business  and  personal  operations  separate.  I'm  pretty  sure  the  IRS  and  courts  frown  upon  this,  and  you're  probably  risking  losing  any  limited  liability  you  may  have.  And  for  keeping  separate  parts  of  the  business  separate,  like  say  stores  in  a  franchise,  one  approach  would  be  subaccounts.  Messy,  I'm  sure.
377322	There  are  many  different  kinds  of  SEC  filings  with  different  purposes.    Broadly  speaking,  what  they  have  in  common  is  that  they  are  the  ways  that  companies  publicly  disclose  information  that  they  are  legally  required  to  disclose.    The  page  that  you  listed  gives  brief  descriptions  of  many  types,  but  if  you  click  through  to  the  articles  on  individual  types  of  filings,  you  can  get  more  info.  One  of  the  most  commonly  discussed  filings  is  the  10-K,  which  is,  as  Wikipedia  says,  "a  comprehensive  summary  of  a  company's  financial  performance".    This  includes  info  like  earnings  and  executive  pay.  One  example  of  a  form  that  some  people  believe  has  potential  utility  for  investors  is  Form  4,  which  is  a  disclosure  of  "insider  trading".    People  with  a  privileged  stake  in  a  company  (executives,  directors,  and  major  shareholders)  cannot  legally  buy  or  sell  shares  without  disclosing  it  by  filing  a  Form  4.    Some  people  think  that  you  can  make  use  of  this  information  in  the  sense  that  if,  for  instance,  the  CEO  of  Google  buys  a  bunch  of  Twitter  stock,  they  may  have  some  reason  for  thinking  it  will  go  up,  so  maybe  you  should  buy  it  too.    Whether  such  inferences  are  accurate,  and  whether  you  can  garner  a  practical  benefit  from  them  (i.e.,  whether  you  can  manage  to  buy  before  everyone  else  notices  and  drives  the  price  up)  is  debatable.  My  personal  opinion  would  be  that,  for  an  average  retail  investor,  readng  SEC  filings  is  unlikely  to  be  useful.    The  reason  is  that  an  average  retail  investor  shouldn't  be  investing  in  individual  companies  at  all,  but  rather  in  mutual  funds  or  ETFs,  which  typically  provide  comparable  returns  with  far  less  risk.    SEC  filings  are  made  by  individual  companies,  so  it  doesn't  generally  help  you  to  read  them  unless  you're  going  to  take  action  related  to  an  individual  company.    It  doesn't  generally  make  sense  to  take  action  related  to  an  individual  company  if  you  don't  have  the  time  and  energy  to  read  a  large  number  of  SEC  filings  to  decide  which  company  to  take  action  on.    If  you  have  the  time  and  energy  to  read  a  large  number  of  SEC  filings,  you're  probably  not  an  average  retail  investor.    If  you  are  a  wheeler  dealer  who  plays  in  the  big  leagues,  you  might  benefit  from  reading  SEC  filings.    However,  if  you  aren't  already  reading  SEC  filings,  you're  probably  not  a  wheeler  dealer  who  plays  in  the  big  leagues.  That  said,  if  you're  a  currently-average  investor  with  big  dreams,  it  could  be  instructive  to  read  a  few  filings  to  explore  what  you  might  do  with  them.    You  could,  for  instance,  allocate  a  "play  money"  fund  of  a  few  thousand  dollars  and  try  your  hand  at  following  insider  trades  or  the  like.    If  you  make  some  money,  great;  if  not,  oh  well.    Realistically,  though,  there  are  so  many  people  who  make  a  living  reading  SEC  filings  and  acting  on  them  every  day  that  you  have  little  chance  of  finding  a  "diamond  in  the  rough"  unless  you  also  make  a  living  by  doing  it  every  day.  It's  sort  of  like  asking  "Should  I  read  Boating  Monthly  to  improve  my  sailing  skills?"    If  you're  asking  because  you  want  to  rent  a  Hobie  Cat  and  go  for  a  pleasure  cruise  now  and  then,  sure,  it  can't  hurt.    If  you're  asking  because  you  want  to  enter  the  America's  Cup,  you  can  still  read  Boating  Monthly,  but  it  won't  in  itself  meaningfully  increase  your  chances  of  winning  the  America's  Cup.
534059	I  use  10-K  and  10-Qs  to  understand  to  read  the  disclosed  risk  factors  related  to  a  business.  Sometimes  they  are  very  comical.  But  when  you  see  that  risk  factor  materializing  you  can  understand  how  it  will  effect  the  company.  For  example,  one  microlending  company's  risk  factor  stated  that  if  Elizabeth  Warren  becomes  head  of  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau  we  will  have  a  hard  time...  so  we  are  expanding  in  Mexico  and  taking  our  politically  unfavorable  lending  practices  there.  I  like  seeing  how  many  authorized  shares  there  are  or  if  there  are  plans  to  issue  more.  An  example  was  where  I  heard  from  former  employees  of  a  company  how  gullible  the  other  employees  at  that  company  were  and  how  they  all  thought  they  were  going  to  get  rich  or  were  being  told  so  by  upper  management.  Poor/Quirky/Questionable/Misleading  management  is  one  of  my  favorite  things  to  look  for  in  a  company  so  I  started  digging  into  their  SEC  filings  and  saw  that  they  were  going  to  do  a  reverse  split  which  would  make  the  share  prices  trade  higher  (while  experiencing  no  change  in  market  cap),  but  then  digging  further  I  saw  that  they  were  only  changing  the  already  issued  shares,  but  keeping  the  authorized  shares  at  the  much  larger  amount  of  shares,  and  that  they  planned  to  do  financing  by  issuing  more  of  the  authorized  shares.  I  exclaimed  that  this  would  mean  the  share  prices  would  drop  by  90%-99%  after  the  reverse  split  and  you  mean  to  tell  me  that  nobody  realizes  this  (employees  or  the  broad  market).  I  was  almost  tempted  to  stand  outside  their  office  and  ask  employees  if  I  could  borrow  their  shares  to  short,  because  there  wasn't  enough  liquidity  on  the  stock  market!  This  was  almost  the  perfect  short  but  it  wasn't  liquid  or  have  any  options  so  not  perfect  after  all.  It  traded  from  $20  after  the  reverse  split  to  $1.27  I  like  understanding  how  much  debt  a  company  is  in  and  the  structure  of  that  debt,  like  if  a  loan  shark  has  large  payments  coming  up  soon.  This  is  generally  what  I  use  those  particular  forms  for.  But  they  contain  a  lot  of  information  A  lot  of  companies  are  able  to  act  they  way  they  do  because  people  do  not  read.
449387	Yes.  But  once  you  chose  the  method  (on  your  first  tax  return),  you  cannot  change  it  without  the  IRS  approval.  Similarly  the  fiscal  year.  For  individuals,  I  can't  think  of  any  reason  why  would  accrual  basis  be  better  than  cash,  or  why  would  an  individual  use  a  fiscal  year  other  than  the  calendar  year.
55200	As  I  understand  it...  Generally  housing  can't  be  considered  a  business  expense  unless  taken  at  your  employer's  explicit  direction,  for  the  good  of  the  business  rather  than  the  employee.  Temporary  assignment  far  enough  from  you  home  office  that  commuting  or  occasional  hotel  nights  are  impractical,    maybe.    In  other  words,  if  they  wouldn't  be  (at  least  theoretically)  willing  to  let  you  put  it  on  an  expense  account,  you  probably  can't  claim  it  here.
224688	Every  month  I  will  get  a  return  in  from  my  share  of  the  profit  which  would  be  used  for  repayment  of  capital  and  interest  in  India.  Not  to  sure  what  the  business  plan  is.  Please  factor  all  the  modalities,  Exchange  rate  fluctuations,  etc.  My  concern  is  regarding  RBI  rules  and  regulations,  FEMA  guidelines,  and  Income  tax.  Under  the  Liberalized  Remittance  Scheme;  Funds  can  be  transferred  outside  India.  Any  profit  you  make  will  be  taxable  in  India.  You  will  have  to  declare  this  pay  tax  in  as  per  schedule.
212810	Of  course,  it  is  a  scam.    Regardless  of  how  the  scam  might  work,  you  already  know  that  the  person  on  the  other  end  is  lying,  and  you  also  know  that  people  in  trouble  don't  contact  perfect  strangers  out  of  the  blue  by  e-mail  for  help,  nor  do  they  call  up  random  phone  numbers  looking  for  help.  Scammers  prey  on  the  gullibility,  greed,  and  sometimes  generosity  of  the  victims.  As  to  how  this  scam  works,  the  money  that  the  scammer  would  be  depositing  into  your  father's  account  is  not  real.    However,  it  will  take  the  bank  a  few  days  to  figure  that  out.    In  the  mean  time,  your  father  will  be  sending  out  real  money  back  to  the  scammer.    When  the  bank  figures  out  what  is  going  on,  they  will  want  your  father  to  pay  back  this  money.
580479	It  used  to  be  Nigerian  royalty,  now  it's  Ghanaian  porn  stars.    Great.    This  is  a  bog-standard  419  scam.    It's  probably  the  most  lucrative  single  swindle  in  the  world.    It's  always  hard  to  get  people  to  believe  they  have  been  tricked,  but  don't  let  your  dad  participate.
527433	The  reason  this  sort  of  question  gets  asked  over  and  over  again  is  because  it's  initially  difficult  to  comprehend  how  you  can  possibly  be  scammed  if  you  have  no  money  in  your  bank  account.  Perhaps  this  would  make  it  easier  to  understand:  Someone  approaches  you  in  the  parking  lot  of  a  mall  and  says,  Excuse  me,  complete  stranger,  please  take  this  $100  bill  and  go  buy  me  a  pair  of  $50  shoes  at  the  shoe  store.  Then  go  buy  whatever  you'd  like  with  the  rest  of  the  money.  Sounds  like  a  good  deal,  right?  The  $100  bill  is  counterfeit.  If  it  were  not,  the  person  would  buy  the  shoes  themselves.  It  doesn't  get  any  simpler  than  that.
28356	It's  a  scam.  Here's  someone  who  paid  "Josie"  2000  pounds  and  lost  it  all  Here's  a  Google  search  result  list  of  how  this  softcore  porn  actor,  Josie  Ann  Miller,  is  being  used  as  the  face  and  name  of  scams
97582	Yes,  this  is  a  scam.  Tell  your  dad  not  to  pay  any  money.    There  will  likely  be  a  large  deposit  in  his  account,  but  if  he  withdraws  the  money  from  his  account,  the  bank  will  come  after  him  looking  for  the  money  when  the  transfer  to  his  account  is  reversed.
129965	So  Linda/Josie's  initial  plan  was  to  have  your  dad  pay  money  to  (supposedly)  help  her  get  the  gold  chest.  After  he  would  have  paid,  there  would  have  been  another  complication,  and  more  yet  (someone  to  bribe,  a  plane  ticket  to  buy,  transport  to  arrange,  customs  to  handle,  whatever,  the  list  would  last  as  long  as  there's  money  to  take).  Even  if  he  does  not  have  much  money,  the  appeal  of  his  share  of  the  treasure  could  have  been  enough  to  tempt  him  to  spend  money  he  can't,  or  borrow,  etc.  Once  "she"  found  out  that  he  doesn't  have  any  money  and/or  is  apparently  not  willing  to  send  any,  "she"  switched  to  a  different  scam:  she  would  send  him  a  large  check,  have  him  deposit  it  on  his  bank  account,  transfer  most  of  the  money  (minus  his  generous  share)  to  "her".  Once  the  money  is  irreversibly  transferred,  the  check  will  bounce.  End  result:  0  in  the  account  before  the  transaction,  minus  a  lot  afterwards.  It's  quite  simple:  if  an  e-mail  from  a  perfect  stranger  includes  any  of  the  following  keywords,  it's  a  scam:
273307	Sadly,  people  with  millions  of  dollars  rarely  give  it  away  to  complete  strangers  that  they  found  at  random  on  the  Internet  in  exchange  for  trivial  efforts.  Anyone  who  claims  to  be  willing  to  give  you  millions  of  dollars  for  just  about  nothing  in  return  is  almost  certainly  pulling  a  scam.  It  doesn't  matter  if  you  can't  figure  out  how  they're  going  to  cheat  you.  They  have  plan.    Just  because  your  father  has  no  money  doesn't  mean  he  can't  be  robbed.  The  scammer  is  almost  surely  planning  to  move  some  money  around,  and  leave  your  father  with  a  debt  that  he  will  be  legally  obligated  to  pay.  She'll  then  take  off  with  the  money.  (Of  course  you  figured  out  that  the  picture  is  fake.  It  may  not  even  be  a  pretty  young  girl  --  that  may  well  just  be  a  persona  the  scammer  created  to  appeal  to  your  father.  It  might  really  be  a  fat,  balding  old  man.)  Your  father  would  be  smarter  to  sit  in  his  back  yard  and  wait  for  money  to  fall  from  the  sky.
101358	The  scammer  is  definitely  up  to  something  fishy.  He  (it's  certain  that  the  she  is  a  he)  may  deposit  some  money  into  your  father's  account  to  gain  his  trust.  After  which,  he  will  propose  to  come  meet  your  dad.  That's  where  the  scamming  begins.  He  will  come  up  with  a  story  about  flight,  VISA  issues,  or  a  problem  he  has  to  solve  before  coming  over.  Another  is  that  he  can  use  your  dad's  empty  account  to  receive  monies  he  scammed  off  people.  That  way  there's  no  direct  link  with  him  and  his  other  victim.
477434	This  should  not  be  taken  to  be  financial  advice  or  guidance.  My  opinions  are  my  own  and  do  not  represent  professional  advice  or  consultation  on  my  part  or  that  my  employer.  Now  that  we  have  that  clear...  Your  idea  is  a  very  good  one.    I'm  not  sure  about  the  benefits  of  a  EBITDA  for  personal  financial  planning  (or  for  financial  analysis,  for  that  matter,  but  we  will  that  matter  to  the  side).  If  you  have  a  moderate  (>$40,000)  income,  then  taxes  should  be  one  the  largest,  if  not  the  largest  chunk  of  your  paycheck  out  the  door.    I  personally  track  my  cash  flow  on  a  day-by-day  basis.  That  is  to  say,  I  break  out  the  actual  cash  payments  (paychecks)  that  I  receive  and  break  them  apart  into  the  14  day  increments  (paycheck/14).  I  then  take  my  expenses  and  do  the  same.  If  you  organize  your  expenses  into  categories,  you  will  receive  some  meaningful  numbers  about  your  daily  liquidity  (i.e:  cash  flow  before  taxes,  after  taxes,  cash  flow  after  house  expenses,  ect)  This  serves  two  purposes.  One,  you  will  understand  how  much  you  can  actually  spend  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  Second,  once  you  realize  your  flexibility  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  it  is  easy  to  plan  and  forecast  your  expenses.
285185	First  of  all,  congratulations  on  saving  some  money.  So  many  people  these  days  do  not  even  get  that  far.  As  far  as  investments,  what  is  best  for  you  depends  heavily  on  your:  Here  is  a  quick  summary  of  types  of  assets  that  are  likely  available  to  you,  and  my  thoughts  on  why  they  may  or  may  not  be  a  good  fit  for  your  situation.  Cash  Equivalents  Cash  Equivalents  are  highly  liquid,  meaning  you  can  get  cash  for  them  on  fairly  short  notice.  In  particular,  Money  Markets  and  Certificates  of  Deposit  (CDs)  are  also  considered  very  safe  when  issued  by  a  bank,  as  they  are  often  insured  against  loss  by  the  government  up  to  a  certain  amount  (this  varies  quite  a  lot  by  country  within  Europe,  see  the  Wikipedia  article  here  for  additional  detail.  Please  note  that  in  the  case  of  a  CD,  you  are  usually  unable  to  get  access  to  your  money  for  the  length  of  the  investment  period,  which  is  usually  a  short  period  of  time  such  as  3  months,  6  months,  or  1  year.  This  is  a  good  choice  if  you  may  need  your  money  back  on  short  notice,  and  your  main  goal  is  to  preserve  your  principal.  However,  the  returns  tend  to  be  very  low  and  often  do  not  keep  pace  with  inflation,  meaning  that  over  several  years,  you  may  lose  "real"  purchasing  power,  even  if  you  don't  lose  nominal  value  in  your  account.  Special  Note  on  Cash  Equivalents  If  the  money  you  want  to  invest  is  also  your  Emergency  Fund,  or  you  do  not  have  an  Emergency  Fund,  I  would  highly  recommend  Cash  Equivalents.  They  will  provide  the  highest  level  of  Liquidity  along  with  a  short  Time  Horizon  so  that  you  can  get  your  money  as  needed  in  the  case  of  unforeseen  expenses  such  as  if  your  car  breaks  down.  Debt  Debt  investments  include  government  and  corporate  bonds.  They  are  still  considered  relatively  safe,  as  the  issuer  would  need  to  default  (usually  this  means  they  are  in  bankruptcy)  in  order  for  you  not  to  be  paid  back.  For  example,  German  bonds  have  been  considered  safer  than  Greek  bonds  recently  based  on  the  underlying  strength  of  the  government.  Unlike  Cash  Equivalents,  these  are  not  guaranteed  against  loss,  which  means  that  if  the  issuer  defaults,  you  could  lose  up  to  100%  of  your  investment.  Bonds  have  several  new  features  you  will  need  to  consider.  One  is  interest  rate  risk.  One  reason  bonds  perform  better  than  cash  equivalents  is  that  you  are  taking  on  the  risk  that  if  interest  rates  rise,  the  fixed  payments  the  bond  promises  will  be  worth  less,  and  the  face  value  of  your  bond  will  fall.  While  most  bonds  are  still  very  Liquid,  this  means  that  if  you  need  to  sell  the  bond  before  it  matures,  you  could  lose  money.  As  mentioned  earlier,  some  bonds  are  riskier  than  others.  Given  that  you  are  looking  for  a  low-risk  investment,  you  would  want  to  select  a  bond  that  is  considered  "invesment  grade"  rather  than  a  riskier  "junk"  bond.  Debt  investments  are  a  good  choice  if  you  can  afford  to  do  without  this  money  for  a  few  years,  and  you  want  to  balance  safety  with  somewhat  better  returns  than  Cash  Equivalents.  Again  though,  I  would  not  recommend  investing  in  Debt  until  you  have  also  built  up  a  separate  Emergency  Fund.  If  you  do  choose  to  invest  in  bonds,  I  recommend  that  you  diversify  your  risks  by  investing  in  a  bond  fund,  rather  than  in  just  one  company's  or  government's  debt.  This  will  reduce  the  likelihood  that  you  will  experience  a  catastrophic  loss.  Ownership  Ownership  assets  includes  stocks  and  other  assets  such  as  real  estate  and  precious  metals  such  as  gold.  While  these  investments  can  have  high  returns,  in  your  situation  I  would  strongly  recommend  that  you  not  invest  in  these  types  of  investments,  for  the  following  reasons:  For  these  reasons,  debt  is  considered  a  safer  investment  than  equity  for  any  particular  company,  government,  or  the  market  as  a  whole.  Ownership  assets  are  a  good  choice  for  people  who  have  a  high  Risk  Tolerance,  long  Time  Horizon,  low  Liquidity  needs,  and  will  not  be  bothered  by  larger  potential  changes  in  the  value  of  the  investment  at  any  given  time.  Special  Note  on  Gold  I  would  consider  Gold  a  very  risky  investment  and  not  a  good  fit  for  you  at  the  moment  based  on  what  you've  shared  in  your  question.  Gold  is  considered  "safe"  in  the  sense  that  people  believe  that  if  the  economy  goes  into  recession,  depression,  or  collapses  entirely,  gold  will  continue  to  be  valuable.  In  a  post-apocalyptic  world  where  paper  money  became  worthless,  it  is  still  a  good  bet  that  gold  will  always  be  considered  valuable  within  human  society  as  a  store  of  value.  That  being  said,  the  price  of  gold  fluctuates  almost  entirely  based  on  how  bad  people  think  things  are  going  to  get.  Think  about  the  difference  between  gold  and  a  company  like  Coca-Cola.  Would  you  like  to  own  100%  of  Coca-Cola?  Of  course,  because  you  know  there  is  a  very  good  chance  that  people  will  continue  to  spend  money  all  over  the  world  on  their  products.  On  the  other  hand,  gold  itself  produces  no  products,  no  sales,  no  profits,  and  no  cash  flow.  As  such,  if  you  buy  gold,  you  are  really  making  a  speculative  bet  that  gold  will  be  in  higher  demand  tomorrow  than  it  is  today.  You  are  buying  an  asset  (the  gold)  rather  than  part  of  a  company's  equity  or  debt  that  is  designed  to  throw  off  payments  to  its  investors  in  the  form  of  bond  payments  or  dividends.  So,  if  people  decide  next  year  that  things  are  improving,  it  is  possible  that  gold  could  lose  value,  given  that  gold  prices  are  at  historically  high  levels.  Gold  could  be  a  good  choice  for  someone  who  has  a  large,  well-diversified  investment  portfolio,  and  who  is  looking  for  a  hedge  to  protect  against  inflation  and  other  risks  that  they  have  taken  on  via  their  other  investments.  I  hope  that  is  helpful  -  best  of  luck  in  your  choices.  Let  us  know  what  you  decide!
280204	Putting  the  money  in  a  bank  savings  account  is  a  reasonably  safe  investment.  Anything  other  than  that  will  come  with  additional  risk  of  various  kinds.  (That's  right;  not  even  a  bank  account  is  completely  free  of  risk.  Neither  is  withdrawing  cash  and  storing  it  somewhere  yourself.)  And  I  don't  know  which  country  you  are  from,  but  you  will  certainly  have  access  to  your  country's  government  bonds  and  the  likes.  You  may  also  have  access  to  mutual  funds  which  invest  in  other  countries'  government  bonds  (bond  or  money-market  funds).  The  question  you  need  to  ask  yourself  really  is  twofold.  One,  for  how  long  do  you  intend  to  keep  the  money  invested?  (Shorter  term  investing  should  involve  lower  risk.)  Two,  what  amount  of  risk  (specifically,  price  volatility)  are  you  willing  to  accept?  The  answers  to  those  questions  will  determine  which  asset  class(es)  are  appropriate  in  your  particular  case.  Beyond  that,  you  need  to  make  a  personal  call:  which  asset  class(es)  do  you  believe  are  likely  to  do  better  or  less  bad  than  others?  Low  risk  usually  comes  at  the  price  of  a  lower  return.  Higher  return  usually  involves  taking  more  risk  (specifically  price  volatility  in  the  investment  vehicle)  but  more  risk  does  not  necessarily  guarantee  a  higher  return  -  you  may  also  lose  a  large  fraction  of  or  even  the  entire  capital  amount.  In  extreme  cases  (leveraged  investments)  you  might  even  lose  more  than  the  capital  amount.  Gold  may  be  a  component  of  a  well-diversified  portfolio  but  I  certainly  would  not  recommend  putting  all  of  one's  money  in  it.  (The  same  goes  for  any  asset  class;  a  portfolio  composed  exclusively  of  stocks  is  no  more  well-diversified  than  a  portfolio  composed  exclusively  of  precious  metals,  or  government  bonds.)  For  some  specifics  about  investing  in  precious  metals,  you  may  want  to  see  Pros  &  cons  of  investing  in  gold  vs.  platinum?.
261016	This  is  second  hand  information  as  I  am  not  a  millionaire,  but  I  work  with  such  people  everyday  and  have  an  understanding  of  how  they  handle  cash:  The  wealthy  people  don't.  Simple.  Definitely  not  if  they  don't  have  to.  Cash  is  a  tool  to  them  that  they  use  only  if  they  get  benefit  of  it  being  a  cash  transaction  (one  of  my  friends  is  a  re-seller  and  he  gets  a  10%  discount  from  suppliers  for  settling  lines  using  cash).  Everything  else  they  place  on  a  line  of  credit.  For  people  who  "dislike"  credit  cards  and  pay  using  ATM  or  debit  cards  might  actually  have  a  very  poor  understanding  of  leverage.  I  assure  you,  the  wealthy  people  have  a  very  good  understanding  of  it!  Frankly,  wealthy  people  pay  less  for  everything,  but  they  deserve  it  because  of  the  extreme  amount  of  leverage  they  have  built  for  themselves.  Their  APRs  are  low,  their  credit  limits  are  insanely  high,  they  have  longer  billing  periods  and  they  get  spoiled  by  credit  card  vendors  all  the  time.  For  example,  when  you  buy  your  groceries  at  Walmart,  you  pay  at  least  a  4%  markup  because  that's  the  standardized  cost  of  processing  credit  cards.  Even  if  you  paid  in  cash!  A  wealthy  person  uses  his  credit  card  to  pay  for  the  same  but  earns  the  same  percentage  amount  in  cash  back,  points  and  what  not.  I  am  sure  littleadv  placed  the  car  purchase  on  his  credit  card  for  similar  reasons!  The  even  more  wealthy  have  their  groceries  shipped  to  their  houses  and  if  they  pay  cash  I  won't  be  surprised  if  they  actually  end  up  paying  much  less  for  fresh  (organic)  vegetables  than  what  equivalent  produce  at  Walmart  would  get  them!  I  apologize  for  not  being  able  to  provide  citations  for  these  points  I  make  as  they  are  personal  observations.
561123	While  you  would  probably  not  use  your  ATM  card  to  buy  a  $1M  worth  mansion,  I've  heard  urban  legends  about  people  who  bought  a  house  on  a  credit  card.  While  can't  say  its  reliable,  I  wouldn't  be  surprised  that  some  have  actual  factual  basis.  I  myself  had  put  a  car  down-payment  on  my  credit  card,  and  had  I  paid  the  sticker  price,  the  dealer  would  definitely  have  no  problem  with  putting  the  whole  car  on  the  credit  card  (and  my  limits  would  allow  it,  even  for  a  luxury  brand).  The  instruments  are  the  same.  There's  nothing  special  you  need  to  have  to  pay  a  million  dollars.  You  just  write  a  lot  of  zeroes  on  your  check,  but  you  don't  need  a  special  check  for  that.  Large  amounts  of  money  are  transferred  electronically  (wire-transfers),  which  is  also  something  that  "regular"  people  do  once  or  twice  in  their  lives.  What  might  be  different  is  the  way  these  purchases  are  financed.  Rich  people  are  not  necessarily  rich  with  cash.  Most  likely,  they're  rich  with  equity:  own  something  that's  worth  a  lot.  In  this  case,  instead  of  a  mortgage  secured  by  the  house,  they  can  take  a  loan  secured  by  the  stocks  they  own.  This  way,  they  don't  actually  cash  out  of  the  investment,  yet  get  cash  from  its  value.  It  is  similarly  to  what  we,  regular  mortals,  do  with  our  equity  in  primary  residence  and  HELOCs.  So  it  is  not  at  all  uncommon  that  a  billionaire  will  in  fact  have  tons  of  money  owed  in  loans.  Why?  Because  the  billions  owned  are  owned  through  stock  valuation,  and  the  cash  used  is  basically  a  loan  secured  by  these  stocks.  It  might  happen  that  the  stocks  securing  the  loans  become  worthless,  and  that  will  definitely  be  a  problem  both  to  the  (now  ex-)billionaire  and  the  bank.  But  until  then,  they  can  get  cash  from  their  investment  without  cashing  out  and  without  paying  taxes.  And  if  they're  lucky  enough  to  die  before  they  need  to  repay  the  loans  -  they  saved  tons  on  money  on  taxes.
114643	I  was  once  the  personal  assistant  to  two  wealthy  NYC  sisters.  They  did  not  pay  for  anything.  For  example,  if  we  were  riding  the  subway,  I  would  pay,  and  be  reimbursed  by  the  Company.  They  had  multiple  residences  and  investment  properties.  Each  property  was  purchased  through  a  separate  Limited  Liablity  Corporation,  and  paid  for  by  the  Company.  When  they  purchased,  donated  or  sold  art,  it  was  through  their  family  Foundation.  Their  income  primarily  came  from  a  draw  of  funds  from  the  family  estate,  although  one  of  them  worked  as  an  architect,  which  provided  further  income.
29617	No,  any  gifts  you  receive  are  not  taxable  to  you.  In  fact,  losing  money  in  a  scam  (as  this  sure  sounds  like  to  me)  can  even  be  tax-deductible  if  you  lose  enough!  I  wouldn't  recommend  accepting  anything.  Usually  people  with  millions  are  dollars  are  capable  of  setting  up  their  own  bank  accounts.
589957	In  a  situation  like  this,  I  presume  you'd  invest  in  the  child  company  if  you  thought  that  the  child  company  would  increase  in  value  at  a  higher  rate  than  the  parent.  You'd  invest  in  the  parent  company  if  you  thought  the  parent  company  would  perform  well  as  a  whole,  but  you  did  not  want  to  assume  the  risk  of  an  individual  company  underneath  it.  Say  the  child  company  is  worth  100  million,  and  the  parent  company  is  worth  500  million.  You've  invested  a  sum  of  money  in  the  child  company.  The  child  company  performs  very  well,  and  increases  in  value  by,  say,  20  million.  As  the  parent  company  owns  the  child,  we  could  say  it  also  increases  in  value  by  roughly  20  million.  The  difference  is  proportional  -  Your  investment  in  the  child  sees  a  20%  gain  in  value,  whereas  your  investment  in  the  parent  sees  a  4%  gain  in  total  value,  as  in  this  example  the  parent  company,  which  owns  nearly  100%  of  the  child  company,  is  worth  5x  more  and  thus  proportionally  sees  1/5  the  increase  in  value,  due  to  it  being  worth  more  as  a  whole.  Think  of  it  similarly  to  a  mutual  fund  or  ETF  that  invests  in  many  different  stocks  on  the  market.  As  the  market  does  well,  that  mutual  fund  or  ETF  does  well,  too.    As  the  mutual  fund  is  made  up  of  many  individual  stocks,  one  stock  performing  very  well,  say  at  a  10-20%  increase  in  value,  does  not  raise  the  value  of  the  ETF  or  mutual  fund  by  10-20%.  The  etf  /  mutual  fund  will  perform  slightly  better  (Assuming  all  other  components  remain  equal  for  this  example),  but  only  proportionally  to  the  fraction  of  it  that's  made  up  of  the  stock  that's  performing  well.
20019	Also  VW  has  more  brands,  i.e.  is  more  diversified  This  isn't  necessarily  a  good  thing  for  investing.    It  makes  the  company  less  likely  to  go  down,  but  it  limits  your  portfolio.    For  example,  say  you  think  that  Hyundai  is  a  good  alternative  to  Volkswagen  (VW)  but  really  like  Audi.    If  you  buy  VW,  you  get  some  Audi  but  a  lot  more  of  the  rest  of  VW.    Then  if  you  bought  Hyundai,  you'd  be  overrepresented  in  that  segment  of  the  market.      Audi  may  not  be  structured  uniquely,  but  it  is  still  the  only  company  selling  Audi  brand  cars.    Perhaps  someone  thinks  that  those  models  will  do  well.    That  person  may  think  that  Audi  will  do  exceptionally  well  in  its  niche.      Having  many  brands  isn't  necessarily  great.    General  Motors  had  something  like  sixteen  brands  before  declaring  bankruptcy.    It  only  has  twelve  now.      Now,  it  sounds  like  you  feel  the  opposite  about  it.    You  don't  particularly  like  Audi  as  a  stock  and  like  VW  better.    Your  reasons  sound  perfectly  reasonable  (I  know  little  about  either  company).    It  may  even  be  that  VW  is  the  only  one  buying  Audi  stock,  because  everyone  else  has  the  same  view  as  you.
220853	Reading  stuff  like  this  makes  me  want  to  go  into  the  debt  collection  business.  Just  send  letters  to  random  people  demanding  money.  Sounds  like  an  easy  way  to  make  a  living.  What's  your  name  and  address?  Just  kidding.  If  they  are  sending  stuff  to  a  Virginia  PO  Box,  close  the  box  with  no  forwarding  address  and  consider  it  case  closed.  If  they  are  targetting  you  personally  in  New  Hampshire,  the  best  thing  to  do  is  to  sue  proactively  before  it  goes  to  collection.  New  Hampshire  has  strict  anti-debt-collection  laws.  Basically,  what  you  do  is  go  to  small  claims  court  and  fill  out  a  one-page  form.  Sue  them  for  $2000,  $3000  or  whatever  is  convenient.  Do  not  hire  a  lawyer.  You  can  do  this  in  2  hours  of  your  own  time.  Your  grounds  are:  (1)  Violation  of  the  creditor  of  NH  FDCA  laws.  According  to  the  laws  the  creditor  has  to  put  all  kinds  of  specific  stuff  in  their  threat  letters.  Since  they  are  not  doing  this,  they  have  violated  NH  FDCA.  Read  the  FDCA  so  you  know  which  specific  items  they  are  violating.  (2)  Extortion.  Since  you  do  not  owe  them  any  money,  demanding  money  from  you  is  extortion  which  is  both  criminally  and  civilly  actionable.  You  sue  them  for  mental  anguish  due  to  extortion.    The  validity  of  your  claims  is  irrelevant.  You  just  need  to  get  them  in  court.  There  are  two  possibilities:  (A)  They  fail  to  show  up.  In  this  case  you  win  and  they  owe  you  $3000  or  whatever.  Not  only  that  if  they  later  try  to  collect  from  you  send  a  copy  of  the  judgement  to  the  credit  bureau  or  collector  or  whatever  and  that  is  proof  you  owe  them  no  money.  (B)  They  hire  some  stooge  local  lawyer  who  appears.  Accept  the  court's  offer  for  arbitration.  When  you  go  into  arbitration  with  the  lawyer  tell  him  you  will  drop  the  lawsuit  if  they  send  you  a  check  for  $500  and  a  hand-written  guarantee  from  him  that  you  will  never  hear  from  his  client  again.  Either  way,  you  come  out  ahead.  By  the  way,  it  is  absolutely  guaranteed  that  the  enemy  lawyer  will  accept  your  offer  in  (B)  above  because  the  SEO  company  is  already  paying  him  $5000  to  show  up  to  answer  your  lawsuit,  and  the  lawyer  does  not  want  to  hang  around  all  morning  in  court  waiting  for  the  case  to  be  heard.  If  he  can  get  out  of  there  in  half  an  hour  for  only  $500  he  will  do  it.  -------------------------------UPDATE  If  all  you  are  getting  is  calls  and  the  caller  refuses  to  identify  themself,  then  it  is  definitely  an  illegal  scam.  It  is  illegal  in  New  Hampshire  to  make  collection  calls  and  refuse  to  full  identify  who  is  calling.  The  phone  company  has  methods  for  dealing  with  illegal  calls.  First  you  have  to  file  a  police  report.  Then  you  call  Verizon  Security  at  1-800-518-5507  (or  whatever  your  phone  company  is).  They  will  trace  the  call  and  identify  the  caller.  They  you  can  make  a  criminal  complaint  in  their  jurisdiction  unless  the  call  is  from  Pakistan  or  something.
107136	Look  at  your  options  with  a  529  program.  If  the  money  is  used  for  education  expenses:  that  currently  includes  tuition,  room  &  board  (even  if  living  off  campus),  books,  transportation;  it  grows  tax  free.  Earnings  are  not  subject  to  federal  tax  and  generally  not  subject  to      state  tax  when  used  for  the  qualified  education  expenses  of  the      designated  beneficiary,  such  as  tuition,  fees,  books,  as  well  as  room      and  board.  Contributions  to  a  529  plan,  however,  are  not  deductible.  If  it  is  a  529  associated  with  your  state  you  can  also  save  on  state  taxes.  You  can  make  contributions  on  a  regular  basis,  or  ad  hoc.  Accounts  can  even  be  setup  by  other  relatives.  I  have  used  a  529  to  fund  two  kids  education.  It  takes  care  of  most  of  your  education  expenses.    529  programs  are  available  from  most  states,  and  even  some  of  the  big  mutual  fund  companies.  Many  have  the  option  of  shifting  the  risk  level  of  the  investments  to  be  more  conservative  as  the  kids  hit  high  school.    Some  states  have  an  option  to  have  you  pay    a  large  sum  when  the  child  is  small  to  buy  semesters  of  college.  The  deal  is  worth  considering  if  you  know  they  will  be  going  to  a  state  school,  the  deal  is  less  good  if  they  will  go  out  of  state  or  to  a  private  college.    The  IRS  does  limit  the  maximum  amount  that  you  can  contribute  in  a  year  an  amount  that  exceeds  the  14,000  annual  gift  limit:  If  in  2014,  you  contributed  more  than  $14,000  to  a  Qualified  Tuition      Plan  (QTP)  on  behalf  of  any  one  person,  you  may  elect  to  treat  up  to      $70,000  of  the  contribution  for  that  person  as  if  you  had  made  it      ratably  over  a  5-year  period.  The  election  allows  you  to  apply  the      annual  exclusion  to  a  portion  of  the  contribution  in  each  of  the  5      years,  beginning  in  2014.  You  can  make  this  election  for  as  many      separate  people  as  you  made  QTP  contributions  One  option  at  the  end  is  to  take  any  extra  money  at  graduation  and  give  it  to  the  child  so  that  it  can  be  used  for  graduate  school,  or  if  the  taxes  and  penalties  are  paid  it  can  be  used  for  that  first  car.  It  can  even  be  rolled  over  to  another  relative.
157712	I  am  a  US  citizen  and  I  want  to  transfer  some  amount  10  lakhs+  to  my  brother  from  my  NRE  account  in  India  to  his  account.  My  brother  is  going  to  purchase  something  for  his  business.  He  is  going  to  return  my  amount  after  3-4  Months  From  the  description  it  looks  like  you  would  like  to  loan  to  your  brother  on  repatriation  basis.  Yes  this  is  allowed.  See  the  RBI  Guide  here  and  here  for  more  details.  There  are  some  conditions;  (iv)  Scheme  for  raising  loans  from  NRIs  on  repatriation  basis      Borrowings  not  exceeding  US$  2,50,000  or  its  equivalent  in  foreign  exchange  by  an  individual  resident  in  India  from  his  close  relatives  resident  outside  India,  subject  to  the  conditions  that  -  a)  the  loan  is  free  of  interest;      b)  the  minimum  maturity  period  of      the  loan  is  seven  years;      c)  The  amount  of  loan  is  received  by  inward      remittance  in  free  foreign  exchange  through  normal  banking  channels  or      by  debit  to  the  NRE/FCNR  account  of  the  non-resident  lender;        d)  The      loan  is  utilised  for  the  borrower's  personal  purposes  or  for  carrying      on  his  normal  business  activity  but  not  for  carrying  on      agricultural/plantation  activities,  purchase  of  immovable  property  or      shares/debentures/bonds  issued  by  companies  in  India  or  for      re-lending.  Although  it  is  mentioned  as  Seven  years,  this  is  revised  to  one  year.  Since  he  cannot  deposit  into  my  NRE  account  I  guess  he  has  to  deposit  it  into  my  NRO  account.  A  repatriate-able  loan  as  above  can  be  deposited  into  NRE  Account.  Is  there  any  illegality  here  doing  such  transaction?  No.  Please  ensure  proper  paper  work  to  show  this  as  loan  and  document  the  money  trail.  Also  once  I  get  my  money  in  NRO  account  do  I  need  to  pay  taxes  in  India  on  the  money  he  deposited?  This  question  does  not  arise.
121832	IRA  distributions  are  reported  on  line  15b  on  the  standard  form  1040.    That  is  in  the  same  Income  section  as  most  of  your  other  income  (including  that  1099  income  and  W2  income,  etc.).    Its  income  is  included  in  the  Line  22  "Total  Income",  from  which  the  Personal  Exemption  (calculated  on  6d,  subtracted  from  the  total  in  line  42)  and  the  Standard  Deduction  (line  40  -  also  Itemized  Deduction  total  would  be  here)  are  later  reduced  to  arrive  at  Line  43,  "Taxable  Income".  As  such,  yes,  he  might  owe  only  the  10%  penalty  (which  is  reported  on  line  59,  and  you  do  not  reduce  this  by  the  deductions,  as  you  surmised).
48401	There  are  a  few  factors  at  play  here.  Depending  on  the  bank  that  has  offered  you  the  card  there  are  different  types  of  overdraft  protection  that  may  have  been  set  up.  Typically,  if  they  attempt  to  run  the  card  with  no  money,  if  one  of  these  is  in  play,  you  will  be  spared  any  overdraft  fees  by  the  transaction  charging  to  a  designated  overdraft  account,  usually  savings,  or  by  the  transaction  failing  due  to  insufficient  funds.    If  you  know  the  transaction  went  through,  and  you  know  there  were  not  enough  funds  in  the  account  to  cover  the  transactions,  then  you  have  a  few  options.  If  you  have  overdraft  protection  that  auto  charges  insufficient  funds  charges  to  a  separate  account,  then  you  have  nothing  to  worry  about.  If  you  do  not,  most  banks  offer  a  grace  period  where  you  have  until  the  end  of  the  day  to  zero  out  your  account,  that  is  to  say  pay  the  overdraft  amount  and  bring  your  balance  to  at  least  $0.    If  this  is  a  charge  that  occurred  in  the  past,  and  you  have  already  been  charged  an  overdraft  fee,  there  may  still  be  hope.  I  cannot  speak  for  all  banks,  but  I  know  that  Chase  Bank  offers  a  once  per  year  overdraft  forgiveness,  where  they  will  get  rid  of  the  charges  if  you  agree  to  bring  the  account  out  of  the  negative.  There  is  a  chance  other  banks  will  do  the  same  if  you  call  their  customer  service.
125981	You  can  find  out  the  general  types  of  investments  by  reading  the  public  corporation  10-Q  report  that  is  filed  with  the  SEC  it  can  be  accessed  via  the  EDGAR  system.  It  will  not  tell  you  what  securities  they  have,  but  it  does  identify  the  short  term  and  long  term  investments  categories  and  their  value.
582185	Short  term  investments,  treasuries,  current  accounts.
170147	They  are  using  several  banks,  hedge  funds  or  other  financial  institutions,  in  order  to  diversify  the  risk  inherent  to  the  fact  that  the  firm  holding  (a  fraction  of)  their  cash,  can  be  insolvent  which  would  makes  them  incur  a  really  big  loss.  Also,  the  most  available  form  of  cash  is  very  often  reinvested  everyday  in  overnight*products  and  any  other  highly  liquid  products,  so  that  it  can  be  available  quickly  if  needed.  Since  they  are  aware  that  they  are  not  likely  to  need  all  of  their  cash  in  one  day,  they  also  use  longer  terms  or  less  liquid  investments  (bonds,  stocks,  etc..).
448431	For  tax  optimization,  cash  is  stored  mostly  overseas,  according  to  the  New  York  Times.  For  Apple,  everytime  a  song  or  an  app  is  bought  in  Europe,  Africa  or  Middle  East,  money  flows  to  iTunes  Sàrl,  in  Luxemburg.  Royalties  on  patents  flow  internally  from  Apple  in  California  to  Apple  in  Ireland.  Then  profits  flow  to  the  Carribean.  The  problem  is  that  cash  cannot  be  brought  back  to  the  USA  without  huge  taxes.
196321	What  theyre  fishing  for  is  whether  the  money  was  earned  in  the  U.S.    It's  essentially  an  interest  shelter,  and/or  avoiding  double  taxation.      They're  saying  if  you  keep  income  you  make  outside  the  US  in  a  bank  inside  the  US,  the  US  thanks  you  for  storing  your  foreign  money  here  and  doesn't  tax  the  interest  (but  the  nation  where  you  earned  that  income  might).      There  is  no  question  that  the  AirBNB  income  is  "connected  with  a  US  trade  or  business".      So  your  next  question  is  whether  the  fraction  of  interest  earned  from  that  income  can  be  broken  out,  or  whether  IRS  requires  you  to  declare  all  the  interest  from  that  account.      Honestly  given  the  amount  of  tax  at  stake,  it  may  not  be  worth  your  time  researching.      Now  since  you  seem  to  be  a  resident  nonresident  alien,  it  seems  apparent  that  whatever  economic  value  you  are  creating  to  earn  your  salary,  is  being  performed  in  the  United  States.  If  this  is  for  an  American  company  and  wages  paid  in  USD,  no  question,  that's  a  US  trade  or  business.  But  what  if  it's  for  a  Swedish  company  running  on  Swedish  servers,  serving  Swedes  and  paid  in  Kroner  to  a  Swedish  bank  which  you  then  transfer  to  your  US  bank?  Does  it  matter  if  your  boots  are  on  sovereign  US  soil?    This  is  a  complex  question,  and  some  countries  (UK)  say  "if  your  boots  are  in  our  nation,  it  is  trade/income  in  our  nation"...  Others  (CA)  do  not.    This  is  probably  a  separate  question  to  search  or  ask.  To  be  clear,  the  fact  that  your  days  as  a  teacher  or  trainee  do  not  count  toward  residency,  is  a  separate  question  from  whether  your  salary  as  same  counts  as  US  income.
393314	It  says  that  you  are  exempt  "as  long  as  such  interest  income  is  not  effectively  connected  with  a  United  States  trade  or  business".  So  the  interest  is  from  money  earned  from  doing  business  with/through  AirBnb,  a  US  company.  So  you  will  have  to  report  it.  Even  if  your  bank  doesn't  send  you  a  1099-INT,  you  have  to  report  it,  unless  it  is  under  $0.49  because  the  IRS  allows  rounding.
128752	This  form  is  due  March  15.  This  year,  the  15th  is  Saturday,  so  the  deadline  is  Monday  March  17th.    Keep  in  mind,  the  software  guys  would  have  two  choices,  wait  until  every  last  form  is  finalized  before  releasing,  or  put  the  software  out  by  late  November  when  80%+  are  good  to  go.    Nothing  is  broken  in  this  process.  Keep  in  mind  that  there  are  different  needs  depending  on  the  individual.  I  like  to  grab  a  copy  in  early  December,  and  have  a  preliminary  idea  of  what  my  return  with  look  like.  I'll  also  know  if  I'll  owe  so  much  that  I  should  send  in  a  quarterly  tax  payment.    The  IRS  isn't  accepting  any  return  until  1/31  I  believe,  so  you've  lost  no  time.    When  you  open  the  program,  it  usually  ask  to  'phone  home'  and  update.  In  a  couple  weeks,  all  should  be  well.    (Disclosure  -  I  have  guest  posted  on  tax  issues  at  both  TurboTax  and  H&R  Block's  blogs.  The  above  are  my  own  views.)
581345	The  forms  get  updated  every  year,  and  the  software  providers  need  to  get  approved  by  the  IRS  every  year.  "Form  is  not  yet  finalized"  means  that  this  year  form  hasn't  been  approved  yet.  IRS  starts  accepting  returns  on  January  31st  anyway,  nothing  to  be  worried  about.  Why  are  you  nearing  a  deadline?  The  deadline  for  1120  (corporate  tax  return)  is  2  and  1/2  months  after  your  corp  year  end,  which  if  you're  a  calendar  year  corp  is  March  15th.  If  your  year  end  is  in  November/December  -  you  can  use  the  prior  year  forms,  those  are  finalized.
401111	When  I  have  been  faced  with  this  sort  of  situation  I  have  done  the  split  at  the  bank.    They  had  the  ability  to  recognize  the  deposit  as  a  payroll  transfer  and  split  it  the  way  I  wanted.  I  put  a  specific  amount  of  money  into  checking,  another  amount  of  money  into  the  mortgage,  and  a  specific  amount  of  money  into  another  fund.  The  balance,  whether  it  was  $1  or  any  other  amount,  went  in  to  savings.  That  meant  that  I  transferred  the  amounts  I  needed  to  pay  my  budgeted  living  expenses  and  what  ever  I  made  above  that  went  to  savings.  In  months  I  made  extra,  more  was  available  to  be  saved.
502223	You  just  need  to  average  out  the  weekly  hours  and  income  over  the  year.  So  if  his  yearly  income  is  $100,000  p.a.  then  this  would  average  out  to  $2000  per  week  of  which  15%  would  be  $300  per  week.  It  does  not  have  to  be  exactly  15%  per  week  as  long  as  over  the  long  run  your  saving  your  target  15%.  If  he  gets  a  pay  rise  you  can  include  this  in  the  saving  plan.  Say  he  gets  a  5%  increase  in  pay  you  would  increase  the  $300  per  week  by  5%  to  $315  per  week.
295509	This  answer  is  assuming  you're  in  the  US,  which  apparently  you're  not.  I  doubt  that  the  rules  in  the  EU  are  significantly  different,  but  I  don't  know  for  sure.  In  case  of  an  IRS  control,  is  it  ok  to  say  that  I  regularly  connect      remotely  to  work  from  home  although  in  the  work  contract  it  says  I      must  work  at  client's  office?  No.  Are  there  any  other  ways  I  can  prove  that  this  deduction  is  valid?  No.  You  can't  prove  something  is  valid  when  its  not.  You  can  only  deduct  home  office  expense  if  it  is  used  exclusively  for  your  business,  and  your  bedroom  obviously  is  not.
380165	You  can  do  it,  provided  that  the  bedroom  is  ONLY  set  up  as  an  office.  That  is,  no  bed,  TV  or  other  stuff.  You  can  stretch  it  a  bit,  considering  a  TV  is  also  a  monitor,  a  couch  is  also  a  visitor  couch.  Whatever  route  you  choose  you  have  to  be  able  to  justify  what  everything  is  doing  there  in  case  of  a  visit  from  the  authorities.  I  am  (was)  in  exactly  the  same  situation  for  two  years  and  had  no  problem  deducting  ~30%  of  the  housing  costs.  That  is,  the  usage  of  bathroom  and  utilities  is  calculated  as  proportional  to  the  surface  area  given  to  the  office.  It  might  make  more  sense  to  move  into  a  larger  apartment  just  so  you  can  have  one  designated  office  room.  Edit:  the  above  applies  in  Germany,  YMMV,  IANAL,  etc.  EU  is  pretty  consistent  though  in  regulations  and  as  far  as  I  know  the  above  aplies  in  most  EU  countries.

511240	Probably  not.  If  you  were  at  a  small  company  and  asked  such  a  question,  you'd  get  advice  and  links  to  erisa  or  other  case  law,  etc.    it's  safe  to  say  that  a  Fortune  500  company  such  as  IBM  is  going  to  have  their  facts  in  order,  and  not  going  to  run  afoul  of  the  rules  in  these  cases  (vesting  rules  and  takeover  of  other  company).    I  was  in  a  company  that  cancelled  its  pension  program.  Those  of  us  with  the  required  years  got  the  option  of  a  lump  sum  payout,  those  with  less  than  5  years  had  no  vested  value  and  got  nothing.  One  month  longer  employment,  in  the  case  of  a  particular  coworker,  would  have  given  him  a  lump  sum  worth  nearly  6  months  pay.
505673	Unfortunately,  the  money  that  is  not  vested  is  not  yours.    It  belongs  to  your  employer.    They  have  promised  to  give  it  to  you  after  you  have  been  with  the  company  for  a  certain  length  of  time,  but  if  you  aren't  still  with  the  company  after  that  time,  no  matter  what  the  reason,  the  money  never  becomes  yours.  Sorry  to  hear  about  this.    It  would  have  been  nice  if  your  company  had  waived  the  vesting  requirement  like  this  guy's  employer  did,  but  I  don't  think  they  are  required  to  do  so,  unfortunately.  If  it's  a  lot  of  money,  you  could  ask  an  attorney,  but  as  @JoeTaxpayer  said,  AT&T  and  IBM  probably  know  what  they  are  doing.
406561	The  limit  on  SEP  IRA  is  25%,  not  20%.    If  you're  self-employed  (filing  on  Schedule  C),  then  it's  taken  on  net  earning,  which  in  your  example  would  be  25%  of  $90,000.  (https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people)  JoeTaxpayer  is  correct  as  regards  the  401(k)  limits.    The  elective  deferrals  are  per  person  -  That's  a  cap  in  sum  across  multiple  plans  and  across  both  traditional  and  Roth  if  you  have  those.    In  general,  it's  actually  across  other  retirement  plan  types  too  -  See  below.  If  you're  self-employed  and  set-up  a  401(k)  for  your  own  business,  the  elective  deferral  is  still  aggregated  with  any  other  401(k)  plans  in  which  you  participate  that  year,  but  you  can  still  make  the  employer  contribution  on  your  own  plan.  This  IRS  page  is  current  a  pretty  good  one  on  this  topic:    https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/one-participant-401k-plans  Key  quotes  that  are  relevant:  The  business  owner  wears  two  hats  in  a  401(k)  plan:  employee  and  employer.  Contributions  can  be  made  to  the  plan  in  both  capacities.  The  owner  can  contribute  both:  •Elective  deferrals  up  to  100%  of  compensation  (“earned  income”  in  the  case  of  a  self-employed  individual)  up  to  the  annual  contribution  limit:    ◦$18,000  in  2015  and  2016,  or  $24,000  in  2015  and  2016  if  age  50  or  over;  plus  •Employer  nonelective  contributions  up  to:    ◦25%  of  compensation  as  defined  by  the  plan,  or  ◦for  self-employed  individuals,  see  discussion  below  It  continues  with  this  example:  The  amount  you  can  defer  (including  pre-tax  and  Roth  contributions)  to  all  your  plans  (not  including  457(b)  plans)  is  $18,000  in  2015  and  2016.  Although  a  plan's  terms  may  place  lower  limits  on  contributions,  the  total  amount  allowed  under  the  tax  law  doesn’t  depend  on  how  many  plans  you  belong  to  or  who  sponsors  those  plans.  EXAMPLE  Ben,  age  51,  earned  $50,000  in  W-2  wages  from  his  S  Corporation  in  2015.  He  deferred  $18,000  in  regular  elective  deferrals  plus  $6,000  in  catch-up  contributions  to  the  401(k)  plan.  His  business  contributed  25%  of  his  compensation  to  the  plan,  $12,500.  Total  contributions  to  the  plan  for  2015  were  $36,500.  This  is  the  maximum  that  can  be  contributed  to  the  plan  for  Ben  for  2015.  A  business  owner  who  is  also  employed  by  a  second  company  and  participating  in  its  401(k)  plan  should  bear  in  mind  that  his  limits  on  elective  deferrals  are  by  person,  not  by  plan.  He  must  consider  the  limit  for  all  elective  deferrals  he  makes  during  a  year.  Notice  in  the  example  that  Ben  contributed  more  that  than  his  elective  limit  in  total  (his  was  $24,000  in  the  example  because  he  was  old  enough  for  the  $6,000  catch-up  in  addition  to  the  $18,000  that  applies  to  everyone  else).    He  did  this  by  declaring  an  employer  contribution  of  $12,500,  which  was  limited  by  his  compensation  but  not  by  any  of  his  elective  contributions.  Beyond  the  401(k),  keep  in  mind  that  elective  contributions  are  capped  across  different  types  of  retirement  plans  as  well,  so  if  you  have  a  SEP  IRA  and  a  solo  401(k),  your  total  contributions  across  those  plans  are  also  capped.    That's  also  mentioned  in  the  example.  Now  to  the  extent  that  you're  considering  different  types  of  plans,  that's  a  whole  question  in  itself  -  One  that  might  be  worth  consulting  a  dedicated  tax  advisor.    A  few  things  to  consider  (not  extensive  list):  As  for  payroll  /  self-employment  tax:  Looks  like  you  will  end  up  paying  Medicare,  including  the  new  "Additional  Medicare"  tax  that  came  with  the  ACA,  but  not  SS:  If  you  have  wages,  as  well  as  self-employment      earnings,  the  tax  on  your  wages  is  paid  first.      But  this  rule  only  applies  if  your  total  earnings      are  more  than  $118,500.  For  example,  if  you      will  have  $30,000  in  wages  and  $40,000  in  selfemployment      income  in  2016,  you  will  pay  the      appropriate  Social  Security  taxes  on  both  your      wages  and  business  earnings.  In  2016,  however,      if  your  wages  are  $78,000,  and  you  have  $40,700      in  net  earnings  from  a  business,  you  don’t  pay      dual  Social  Security  taxes  on  earnings  more      than  $118,500.  Your  employer  will  withhold      7.65  percent  in  Social  Security  and  Medicare      taxes  on  your  $78,000  in  earnings.  You  must      pay  15.3  percent  in  Social  Security  and  Medicare      taxes  on  your  first  $40,500  in  self-employment      earnings  and  2.9  percent  in  Medicare  tax  on  the      remaining  $200  in  net  earnings.  https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10022.pdf  Other  good  IRS  resources:
245654	Yes,  it  does  matter.  You  are  right  that  lower  demand  for  a  stock  will  drive  its  price  down.  Lower  stock  prices  can  hurt  the  company.  Take  a  look  at  Fixee's  answer  to  this  question:  a  declining  share  price  will  make  it  hard  to  secure  credit,  attract  further  investors,  build  partnerships,  etc.  Also,  employees  are  often  holding  options  or  in  a  stock  purchase  plan,  so  a  declining  share  price  can  severely  dampen  morale.  In  an  extreme  case,  if  share  prices  plummet  too  far,  the  company  can  be  pressured  to  reverse-split  the  shares,  and  (eventually)  take  the  company  private.  This  recently  happened  to  Playboy.  If  you  do  not  want  to  support  a  company,  for  whatever  reason,  then  it  is  wise  to  avoid  their  stock.
42625	This  question  drives  at  what  value  a  shareholder  actually  provides  to  a  corporation,  and  by  extent,  to  the  economy.  If  you  subscribe  for  new  shares  (like  in  an  Initial  Public  Offering),  it  is  very  straightforward  to  say  "I  have  provided  capital  to  the  corporation,  which  it  is  using  to  advance  its  business."  If  you  buy  shares  that  already  exist  (like  in  a  typical  share  purchase  on  a  public  exchange),  your  money  doesn't  go  to  the  company.  Instead,  it  goes  to  someone  who  paid  someone  who  paid  someone  who  paid  someone  (etc.)  who  originally  contributed  money  to  the  corporation.    In  theory,  the  value  of  a  share  price  does  not  directly  impact  the  operation  of  the  company  itself,  apart  from  what  @DanielCarson  aptly  noted  (employee  stock  options  are  affected  by  share  price,  impacting  morale,  etc.).  This  is  because  in  theory,  the  true  value  of  a  company  (and  thus,  the  value  of  a  share)  is  the  present  value  of  all  future  cashflows  (dividends  +  final  liquidation).  This  means  that  in  a  technical  sense,  a  company's  share  price  should  result  from  the  company's  value.  The  company's  true  value  does  not  result  from  the  share  price.  But  what  you  are  doing  as  a  shareholder  is  impacting  the  liquidity  available  to  other  potential  investors  (also  as  mentioned  by  @DanielCarson,  in  reference  to  the  desirability  for  future  financing).  The  more  people  who  invest  their  money  in  the  stock  market,  the  more  liquid  those  stocks  become.  This  is  the  true  value  you  add  to  the  economy  by  investing  in  stocks  -  you  add  liquidity  to  the  market,  decreasing  the  risk  of  capital  investment  generally.  The  fewer  people  there  are  who  are  willing  to  invest  in  a  particular  company,  the  harder  it  is  for  an  investor  to  buy  or  sell  shares  at  will.  If  it  is  difficult  to  sell  shares  in  a  company,  the  risk  of  holding  shares  in  that  company  is  higher,  because  you  can't  "cash  out"  as  easily.  This  increased  risk  then  does  change  the  value  of  the  shares  -  because  even  though  the  corporation's  internal  value  is  the  same,  the  projected  cashflows  of  the  shares  themselves  now  has  a  question  mark  around  the  ability  to  sell  when  desired.  Whether  this  actually  has  an  impact  on  anything  depends  on  how  many  people  join  you  in  your  declaration  of  ethical  investing.  Like  many  other  forms  of  social  activism,  success  relies  on  joint  effort.  This  goes  beyond  the  direct  and  indirect  impacts  mentioned  above;  if  'ethical  investing'  becomes  more  pronounced,  it  may  begin  to  stigmatize  the    target  companies  (fewer  people  wanting  to  work  for  'blacklist'  corporations,  fewer  people  buying  their  products,  etc.).
51203	Brokers  need  to  assess  your  level  of  competency  to  ensure  that  they  don't  allow  you  to  "bite  off  more  than  you  can  chew"  and  find  yourself  in  a  bad  situation.  Some  brokers  ask  you  to  rate  your  skills,  others  ask  you  how  long  you've  been  trading,  it  always  varies  based  on  broker.  I  use  IB  and  they  gave  me  a  questionairre  about  a  wide  range  of  instruments,  my  skill  level,  time  spent  trading,  trades  per  year,  etc.    Many  brokers  will  use  your  self-reported  experience  to  choose  what  types  of  instruments  you  can  trade.  Some  will  only  allow  you  to  start  with  stocks  and  restrict  access  to  forex,  options,  futures,  etc.  until  you  ask  for  readiness  and,  for  some  brokers,  even  pass  a  test  of  knowledge.  Options  are  very  commonly  restricted  so  that  you  can  only  go  long  on  an  option  when  you  own  the  underlying  stock  when  you  are  a  "newbie"  and  scale  out  from  there.  Many  brokers  adopt  a  four-tiered  approach  for  options  where  only  the  most  skilled  traders  can  write  naked  options,  as  seen  here.  It's  important  to  note  that  all  of  this  information  is  self-reported  and  you  are  not  legally  bound  to  answer  honestly  in  any  way.  If,  for  example,  you  are  well  aware  of  the  risks  of  writing  naked  options  and  want  to  try  it  despite  never  trading  one  before,  there  is  nothing  stopping  you  from  saying  you've  traded  options  for  10  years  and  be  given  the  privilege  by  your  broker.  Of  course,  they're  just  looking  out  for  your  best  interest,  but  you  are  by  no  means  forced  into  the  scheme  if  you  do  not  wish  to  be.
23121	In  Canada,  for  example,  they  are  expected  or  required  to  find  out.  They  call  it,  The  “Know  Your  Client”  rule,  part  of  which  is  knowing  your  "Investment  knowledge  and  experience".  They  say  it  is,  "to  ensure  their  advice  is  suitable  for  you".  I  have  always  been  given  that  kind  of  form  to  fill  in,  when  opening  an  account.
391715	Yes,  this  is  common  and  in  some  cases  may  be  required.    They  may  use  it  for  marketing  at  some  level,  but  they  also  use  it  for  risk  management  in  deciding,  for  example,  how  much  margin  to  offer  and  whether  to  approve  access  to  "riskier"  products  like  stock  options.
271129	In  many  places  there  are  legal  requirements  to  do  so,  essentially  made  to  prevent  brokers  from  selling  high-risk  products  as  if  they  were  deposits  with  guaranteed  safety  of  your  funds.  There  also  may  be  prohibitions  on  offering  high-risk/high-return  products  to  beginner  customers,  e.g.  requiring  accredited  investor  status  claiming  that  yes,  you  really  know  how  this  works  and  are  informed  of  the  involved  risks  or  you're  not  allowed  to  invest  in  that  product.    Making  untrue  claims  of  being  not  a  beginner  may  limit  your  options  if  your  broker  does  cheat  you  in  some  manner,  as  it  gives  them  a  solid  argument  that  you  confirmed  that  you  understand  how  their  pump-and-dump  scheme  works  and  are  yourself  responsible  for  losing  your  money  to  them.
147624	The  decision  whether  this  test  is  or  is  not  met  seems  to  be  highly  dependent  on  the  specific  situation  of  the  employer  and  the  employee.    I  think  that  you  won't  find  a  lot  of  general  references  meeting  your  needs.  There  is  such  a  thing  as  a  "private  ruling  letter,"  where  individuals  provide  specific  information  about  their  situation  and  request  the  IRS  to  rule  in  advance  on  how  the  situation  falls  with  respect  to  the  tax  law.    I  don't  know  a  lot  about  that  process  or  what  you  need  to  do  to  qualify  to  get  a  private  ruling.    I  do  know  that  anonymized  versions  of  at  least  some  of  the  rulings  are  published.    You  might  look  for  such  rulings  that  are  close  to  your  situation.  I  did  a  quick  search  and  found  two  that  are  somewhat  related:  As  regards  your  situation,  my  (non-expert)  understanding  is  that  you  will  not  pass  in  this  case  unless  either  (a)  the  employer  specifies  that  you  must  live  on  the  West  Coast  or  you'll  be  fired,  (b)  the  employer  would  refuse  to  provide  space  for  you  if  you  moved  to  Boston  (or  another  company  location),  or  (c)  you  can  show  that  you  could  not  possibly  do  your  job  out  of  Boston.    For  (c),  that  might  mean,  for  example,  you  need  to  make  visits  to  client  locations  in  SF  on  short-notice  to  meet  business  requirements.    If  you  are  only  physically  needed  in  SF  occasionally  and  with  "reasonable"  notice,  I  don't  think  you  could  make  it  under  (c),  although  if  the  employer  doesn't  want  to  pay  travel  costs,  then  you  might  still  make  it  under  (a)  in  this  case.
63919	I'm  not  a  tax  professional,  but  as  I  understand  it,  you  are  not  expected  to  commute  from  San  Francisco  to  Boston.    :)  If  your  employer  has  not  provided  you  with  an  external  office,  then  yes,  you  have  very  likely  met  the  "convenience  of  the  employer"  test.  However,  to  take  the  home  office  deduction,  there  are  many  requirements  that  have  to  be  met.  You  can  read  more  at  the  Nolo  article  Can  You  Deduct  Your  Home  Office  When  You're  an  Employee?  (Thanks,  keshlam)  The  home  office  deduction  has  many  nuances  and  is  enough  of  an  IRS  red  flag  that  you  would  be  well-advised  to  talk  to  an  accountant  about  it.    You  need  to  be  able  to  show  that  it  is  exclusively  and  necessarily  used  for  your  job.  Another  thing  to  remember:  as  an  employee,  the  home  office  deduction,  if  you  take  it,  will  be  deducted  on  Schedule  A,  line  21  (unreimbursed  employee  expenses),  among  other  Miscellaneous  Deductions.    Deductions  in  this  section  need  to  exceed  2%  of  your  adjusted  gross  income  before  you  can  start  to  deduct.    So  it  will  not  be  worth  it  to  pursue  the  deduction  if  your  income  is  too  high,  or  your  housing  expenses  are  too  low,  or  your  office  is  too  small  compared  to  the  rest  of  your  house,  or  you  don't  itemize  deductions.
543114	If  your  employer  does  not  provide  you  with  a  place  to  work  but  nevertheless  expects  you  to  get  work  done,  then  having  a  place  to  work  is  a  condition  of  employment.
367577	I'm  not  a  tax  lawyer,  but  from  what  I  can  tell  it  looks  like  you'd  be  eligible  to  use  your  contractor  income  to  fund  a  Solo  401(k).    http://www.irafinancialgroup.com/whatissolo401k.php  "To  access  these  benefits  an  investor  must  meet  two  eligibility  requirements:  The  presence  of  self  employment  activity.  The  absence  of  full-time  employees."  And  from  the  IRS  itself  (http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/forum08_401k.pdf)
88508	Here  are  the  basic  questions  I  usually  ask  any  new  business  startup:  Do  these  numbers/answers  seem  reasonable  to  you  and  is  some  benchmark  available  that  allows  you  to  see  how  likely  this  is?      Remember,  particularly  in  Internet-based  advertising  ventures,  the  client  may  be  indirect.    The  person  who  clicks  on  a  Google  context-based  link  is  not  directly  Google's  client.    The  person  who  decided  to  host  AdWords  code  on  their  site  is  the  direct  client.  You're  also  going  to  want  to  see  a  Gant  chart  or  some  process  chart  indicating  exactly  what  needs  to  be  done,  at  what  cost  and  by  whom.    Answers  to  these  questions  give  a  sense  of  not  only  how  seriously  they  are  taking  the  business,  but  also  how  organised.  My  final  question:  who  is  your  first  client?  They  need  either  someone  who  is  going  to  contract  the  service,  or  have  a  clear  indication  of  where  income  is  going  to  come  from,  on  their  first  day  of  trading.  Their  task  is  to  sell  their  idea  to  you  by  proving  that  it  will  return  on  your  investment  and  be  profitable.    From  the  strength  of  these  answers  you  can  gauge  the  value  of  your  investment  to  them,  how  critical  it  is,  how  risky  the  opportunity  and  -  ultimately  -  the  stake  and  returns  you  should  expect.
252942	In  addition  to  evaluating  the  business  (great  answer),  consider  the  potential  payoff.  If  bonds  pay  off  in  the  5-10%  range,  the  S&P500  has  averged  10.5%.  You  should  be  expecting  a  payoff  of  15-20%  to  invest  in  something  riskier  than  the  stock  market.    That  means  that  if  you  invest  $10k,  then  in  5  years  you'll  need  to  get  out  $25K  (20%  returns  over  5  years).      If  you  get  less  than  this  much  in  5  years,  the  risk-to-reward  ratio  probably  rules  this  out  as  a  good  investment.
234506	Turukawa's  answer  is  quite  good,  and  for  your  own  specific  situation,  you  might  begin  by  being  sceptical  about  what  you  are  getting  for  investing  a  few  thousand  dollars.    With  the  exception  of  Paul  Graham's  Y-Combinator,  there  are  very  few  opportunities  to  invest  at  that  type  of  level,  and  Y-Combinator  provides  a  lot  of  other  assistance  besides  their  modest  initial  investment.      I  can  tell  from  your  post  that  you  think  like  an  investor.    It  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  entrepreneurial  programmers  that  you  will  be  backing  will  be  wired  that  way.      From  the  modest  amount  that  you  are  investing,  you  are  unlikely  to  be  the  lead  investor  in  this  opportunity.    If  you  are  interested  in  proceeding,  simply  stick  along  for  the  ride,  examining  the  terms  and  documents  that  more  significant  investors  will  be  demanding.    Remain  positive  and  supportive,  but  simply  wait  to  sign  on  the  dotted  line  until  others  have  done  the  heavy  lifting.  For  more  insights  into  startups  themselves,  see  Paul  Graham's  essays  at  www.paulgraham.com.    He's  the  real  deal,  and  his  recent  essays  will  provide  you  with  current  insights  about  software  startups.  Good  luck.
232388	Previous  answers  have  done  a  great  job  with  the  "Should  I  invest?"  question.      One  thing  you  may  be  overlooking  is  the  question  "Am  I  allowed  to  invest?"  For  most  offerings  of  stock  in  a  startup,  investors  are  required  to  be  accredited  by  the  SEC's  definition.    See  this  helpful  quora  post  for  more  information  on  requirements  to  invest  in  startups.  To  be  honest,  if  a  startup  is  looking  for  investors  to  put  in  "a  few  thousand  dollars"  each,  this  would  raise  my  alarm  bells.    The  cost  and  hassle  of  the  paperwork  to  (legitimately)  issue  shares  in  that  small  of  number  would  lead  me  just  to  use  a  credit  card  to  keep  me  going  until  I  was  able  to  raise  a  larger  amount  of  capital.
126065	You  seem  to  have  all  your  financial  bases  covered,  and  others  have  given  you  good  financial  advice,  so  I  will  try  to  give  you  some  non-financial  ideas.  The  first  and  most  important  thing  is  that  you  are  investing  with  a  long  time  friend,  so  the  dynamics  are  a  lot  different  that  if  you  had  recently  met  a  stranger  with  an  "interesting"  new  idea.  The  first  thing  you  need  to  ask  yourself  is  if  your  friendship  will  survive  if  this  thing  doesn't  go  well?  You've  already  said  you  can  afford  to  lose  the  money  so  that's  not  a  worry,  but  will  there  be  any  "recriminations?"  The  flip  side  is  also  true;  if  the  venture  succeeds,  you  should  be  able  to  go  further  with  it  because  he's  your  friend.  You  know  your  friend  better  (back  to  grade  school)  than  almost  anyone  else,  so  here  are  some  things  to  ask  yourself:  What  does  your  friend  have  that  will  give  him  a  chance  to  succeed;  tech  savvy,  a  winning  personality,  a  huge  rolodex,  general  business  savvy,  something  else?  If  your  guardian  angel  had  told  you  that  one  of  your  friends  was  planning  to  embark  on  an  internet/advertising  venture,  is  this  the  one  you  would  have  guessed?  Conversely,  knowing  that  your  friend  was  planning  to  do  a  start  up,  is  this  the  kind  of  venture  you  would  have  guessed?  How  does  "internet"  and  "advertising"  fit  in  with  what  you  are  doing?  If  this  venture  succeeds,  could  it  be  used  to  help  your  professional  development  and  career,  maybe  as  a  supplier  or  customer?  Can  you  see  yourself  leaving  your  current  job  and  joining  your  friend's  (now  established)  company  as  a  vice  president  or  acting  as  a  member  of  its  board  of  directors,  the  latter  perhaps  while  pursuing  your  current  career  path?    Are  your  other  mutual  friends  investing?  Are  some  of  them  more  tech  savvy  than  you  and  better  able  to  judge  the  company's  prospects  of  success?  To  a  certain  extent,  there  is  "safety  in  numbers"  and  even  if  there  isn't,  "misery  loves  company."  On  the  upside,  would  you  feel  left  out  if  everyone  in  your  crowd  caught  "the  next  Microsoft"  except  you?
156662	Yes,  there's  a  way.  I  actually  wrote  a  blog  post  about  it.  Its  a  new  service  from  the  IRS  which  allows  you  pulling  your  account  online.  IRS  also  has  an  instruction  page  just  for  this  case  here.
74560	How  are  shareholders  sure  to  receive  a  fair  percentage  of  each  company?    At  the  time  the  split  occurs,  each  investor  owns  the  same  proportion  of  each  new  company  that  they  owned  in  the  first.    What  the  investor  does  with  it  after  that  (selling  one,  for  example)  is  irrelevant  from  a  fairness  perspective.  Suppose  company  A  splits  into  companies  B  and  C.    You  own  enough  stock  to  have  1%  of  A.    It  splits.    Now  you  have  a  bunch  of  shares  of  B  and  C.    How  much?    Well,  you  have  1%  of  B  and  1%  of  C.    What  if  all  the  profitable  projects  are  in  B?    Then  shares  of  B  will  be  worth  more  than  those  of  C.    But  it  should  be  the  case  that  the  value  of  your  shares  of  B  plus  the  value  of  your  shares  of  C  are  equal  to  the  original  value  of  your  shares  of  A.    Completely  fair.    In  fact,  if  the  split  was  economically  justified,  then  B  +  C  >  A.    And  the  gains  are  realized  proportionally  by  all  equityholders.  Remember,  when  a  stock  splits,  every  share  splits  so  that  everyone  owns  both  companies  in  the  same  proportion  as  everyone  else.    Executives  don't  determine  what  the  prices  of  the  resulting  companies  are...that  is  determined  by  the  market.    A  fair  market  will  value  the  child  companies  such  that  together  they  are  worth  what  the  original  was.
85368	I'm  assuming  you're  in  Germany  or  Europe  based  on  your  question,  but  here's  an  American's  perspective  that  should  pertain  you  you  as  well:  Once  you  have  a  steady  income  and  an  emergency  fund  large  enough  to  keep  you  from  going  bankrupt,  then  start  learning  about  retirement  and  investment  options.
147163	Personal  finances  are  not  intuitive  for  everyone,  and  it  can  be  a  challenge  to  know  what  to  do  when  you  haven't  been  taught.    Congratulations  on  recognizing  that  you  need  to  make  a  change.  The  first  step  that  I  would  recommend  is  what  you've  already  done:  Assemble  your  bank  statements  so  you  can  get  an  accurate  picture  of  what  money  you  currently  have.    Keep  organized  folders  so  you  can  find  your  bank  statements  when  you  need  them.  In  addition  to  the  bank  statements  for  your  checking  and  savings  accounts,  you  also  need  to  assess  any  debt  that  you  have.    Have  you  taken  out  any  loans  that  need  to  be  paid  back?    Do  you  have  any  credit  card  debt?    Make  a  list  of  all  your  debts,  and  make  sure  that  you  have  folders  for  these  statements  as  well.  Hopefully,  you  don't  have  any  debts.    But  if  you  are  like  most  people,  you  owe  money  to  someone,  and  you  may  even  owe  more  money  than  you  currently  have  in  your  bank  accounts.    If  you  have  debts,  fixing  this  problem  will  be  one  of  your  goals.  No  matter  what  your  debt  is,  you  need  to  make  sure  that  from  now  on,  you  don't  spend  more  money  than  you  take  in  as  income.    To  do  this,  you  need  to  make  a  budget.  A  budget  is  a  plan  for  spending  your  money.    To  get  started  with  a  budget,  make  a  list  of  all  the  income  you  will  receive  this  month.    Add  it  up,  and  write  that  amount  at  the  top  of  a  page.    Next,  you  want  to  make  a  list  of  all  the  expenses  you  will  have  this  month.    Some  of  these  expenses  are  more  or  less  fixed:  rent,  utility  bills,  etc.    Write  those  down  first.    Some  of  the  expenses  you  have  more  control  over,  such  as  food  and  entertainment.    Give  yourself  some  money  to  spend  on  each  of  these.    You  may  also  have  some  larger  expenses  that  will  happen  in  the  future,  such  as  a  tuition  or  insurance  payment.    Allocate  some  money  to  those,  so  that  by  the  time  that  payment  comes  around,  you  will  have  saved  enough  to  pay  for  those  expenses.  If  you  find  that  you  don't  have  enough  income  to  cover  all  of  your  expenses  in  a  month,  you  need  to  either  reduce  your  expenses  somewhere  or  increase  your  income  until  your  budget  is  at  a  point  where  you  have  money  left  over  at  the  end  of  each  month.  After  you've  gotten  to  this  point,  the  next  step  is  figuring  out  what  to  do  with  that  extra  money  left  over.    This  is  where  your  goals  come  into  play.    If  you  have  debt,  I  recommend  that  one  of  your  first  goals  is  to  eliminate  that  debt  as  fast  as  possible.    If  you  have  no  money  saved,  you  should  make  one  of  your  goals  saving  some  money  as  an  emergency  fund.    See  the  question  Oversimplify  it  for  me:  the  correct  order  of  investing  for  some  ideas  on  what  order  you  should  place  your  goals.  Doing  the  budget  and  tracking  all  of  your  spending  on  paper  is  possible,  but  many  people  find  that  using  the  right  software  to  help  you  do  this  is  much  easier.    I  have  written  before  on  choosing  budgeting  software.    All  of  the  budgeting  software  packages  I  mentioned  in  that  post  are  from  the  U.S.,  but  many  of  them  can  successfully  be  used  in  Europe.    YNAB,  the  program  I  use,  even  has  an  unofficial  German  users  community  that  you  might  find  useful.  One  of  the  things  that  budgeting  software  will  help  you  with  is  the  process  of  reconciling  your  bank  statements.    This  is  where  you  go  through  the  bank  statement  each  month  and  compare  it  to  your  own  record  of  spending  transactions  in  your  budget.    If  there  are  any  transactions  that  appear  in  the  statement  that  you  don't  have  recorded,  you  need  to  figure  out  why.    Either  it  is  an  expense  that  you  forgot  to  record,  or  it  is  a  charge  that  you  did  not  make.    Record  it  if  it  is  legitimate,  or  dispute  the  expense  if  it  is  fraudulent.  For  more  information,  look  around  at  some  of  the  questions  tagged  budget.    I  also  recommend  the  book  The  Total  Money  Makeover  by  Dave  Ramsey,  which  will  provide  more  help  in  making  a  budget  and  getting  out  of  debt.
344236	A  few  practical  thoughts:  A  practical  thing  that  helps  me  immensely  not  to  loose  important  paperwork  (such  as  bank  statements,  bills,  payroll  statement,  all  those  statements  you  need  for  filing  tax  return,  ...)  is:  In  addition  to  the  folder  (Aktenordner)  where  the  statements  ultimately  need  to  go  I  use  a  Hängeregistratur.  There  are  also  standing  instead  of  hanging  varieties  of  the  same  idea  (may  be  less  expensive  if  you  buy  them  new  -  I  got  most  of  mine  used):  you  have  easy-to-add-to  folders  where  you  can  just  throw  in  e.g.  the  bank  statement  when  it  arrives.  This  way  I  give  the  statement  a  preliminary  scan  for  anything  that  is  obviously  grossly  wrong  and  throw  it  into  the  respective  folder  (Hängetasche).  Every  once  in  a  while  I  take  care  of  all  my  book-keeping,  punch  the  statements,  file  them  in  the  Aktenordner  and  enter  them  into  the  software.  I  used  to  hate  and  never  do  the  filing  when  I  tried  to  use  Aktenordner  only.  I  recently  learned  that  it  is  well  known  that  Aktenordner  and  Schnellhefter  are  very  time  consuming  if  you  have  paperwork  arriving  one  sheet  at  a  time.  I've  tried  different  accounting  software  (being  somewhat  on  the  nerdy  side,  I  use  gnucash),  including  some  phone  apps.    Personally,  I  didn't  like  the  phone  apps  I  tried  -  IMHO  it  takes  too  much  time  to  enter  things,  so  I  tend  to  forget  it.  I'm  much  better  at  asking  for  a  sales  receipt  (Kassenzettel)  everywhere  and  sticking  them  into  a  calendar  at  home  (I  also  note  cash  payments  for  which  I  don't  have  a  receipt  as  far  as  I  recall  them  -  the  forgotten  ones  =  difference  ends  up  in  category  "hobby"  as  they  are  mostly  the  beer  or  coke  after  sports).  I  was  also  to  impatient  for  the  cloud/online  solutions  I  tried  (I  use  one  for  business,  as  there  the  archiving  is  guaranteed  to  be  according  to  the  legal  requirements  -  but  it  really  takes  far  more  time  than  entering  the  records  in  gnucash).
361741	There  are  many  paths  to  success,  but  they  all  begin  with  education.  You  made  the  first  big  step  just  by  visiting  here.  We  have  17,000  questions,  arranged  by  tag  so  you  can  view  those  on  a  given  topic.  You  can  sort  by  votes  to  see  the  ones  that  have  the  best  member  acceptance.    I'll  agree  with  Ben  that  one  of  the  best  ones  is  "The  correct  order  of  investing."  We  both  offered  answers  there,  and  that  helps  address  a  big  chunk  of  your  issue.    The  book  recommendations  are  fine,  you'll  quickly  find  that  each  author  has  his/her  own  slant  or  focus  on  a  certain  approach.  For  example,  one  financial  celebrity  (note  -  in  the  US,  there  are  private  advisors,  usually  with  credentials  of  some  sort,  there  are  those  who  work  for  brokers  and  also  offers  help,  there  are  financial  bloggers  (I  am  one),  and  there  are  those  who  are  on  the  radio  or  TV  who  may  or  may  not  have  any  credentials)  suggests  that  credit  cards  are  to  be  avoided.  The  line  in  another  answer  here,  "You're  not  going  to  get  rich  earning  1%  on  a  credit  card,"  is  a  direct  quote  of  one  such  celebrity.  I  disputed  that  in  my  post  "I  got  rich  on  credit  card  points!"  The  article  is  nearly  2  years  old,  the  account  accumulating  the  rewards  has  recently  passed  $34,000.  This  sum  of  money  is  more  wealth  than  81%  of  people  in  the  world  have.    The  article  was  a  bit  tongue  in  cheek  (sarcastic)  but  it  made  a  point.  A  young  person  should  get  a  credit  card,  a  good  one,  with  no  fee,  and  generous  rewards.  Use  the  card  to  buy  only  what  you  can  pay  back  that  month.  At  year  end,  I  can  download  all  my  spending.  The  use  of  the  card  helps,  not  hinders,  the  budgeting  process,  and  provides  a  bit  of  safety  with  its  guarantees  and  theft  protection.    Your  question  really  has  multiple  facets.  If  these  answers  aren't  helpful  enough,  I  suggest  you  ask  a  new  question,  but  focus  on  one  narrow  issue.  "Paying  off  debt"  "Getting  organized"  "Saving"  "Budgeting"  all  seem  to  be  part  of  your  one  question  here.
176424	JoeTaxpayer's  answer  mentions  using  a  third  "house"  account.  In  my  comment  on  his  answer,  I  mentioned  that  you  could  simply  use  a  bookkeeping  account  to  track  this  instead  of  the  overhead  of  an  extra  real  bank  account.  Here's  the  detail  of  what  I  think  will  work  for  you.  If  you  use  a  tool  like  gnucash  (probably  also  possible  in  quicken,  or  if  you  use  paper  tracking,  etc),  create  an  account  called  "Shared  Expenses".  Create  two  sub  accounts  under  that  called  "his"  and  "hers".  (I'm  assuming  you'll  have  your  other  accounts  tracked  in  the  software  as  well.)  I  haven't  fully  tested  this  approach,  so  you  may  have  to  tweak  it  a  little  bit  to  get  exactly  what  you  want.  When  she  pays  the  rent,  record  two  transactions:  When  you  pay  the  electric  bill,  record  two  transactions:  Then  you  can  see  at  a  glance  whether  the  balances  on  "his"  and  "hers"  match.
297391	Why  not  start  a  third  account,  the  "house"  account?  However  you  decide  to  fund  it,  equally  or  in  proportion  to  income,  you  both  chip  in,  and  the  payments  for  all  joint  expenses  come  from  there.  Rent,  utilities,  food,  phone,  cable.
47923	Being  new  does  not  allow  me  yet  to  vote  on  your  question,  but  what  a  good  question  it  is.  We  share  our  opinion  in  separating  finances  in  our  very  well  going  mariage.  Currently  I  have  found  a  sort  of  okay  solution  in  two  websites.  These  are  http://www.yunoo.nl  and  http://www.moneytrackin.com/.  You  can  actually  tag  spendings  with  multiple  tags.    I  don't  like  the  idea  that  the  data  is  on  a  remote  server,  but  since  I  have  not  found  a  proper    local  software  solution,  I  just  naively  trust  their  promise  that  your  data  is  save.  Then  again  our  financial  situation  is  not  that  special.
336387	Websites  like  neobudget  dot  com  or  mint  dot  com  can  help  you  see  where  your  money  is  going,  especially  if  you  use  mostly  checks,  debit  cards,  or  credit  cards  for  your  purchases.    They  are  less  useful  if  you  use  cash  often.
241708	I'd  say  its  time  to  merge  finances!
140067	Call  me  old  fashioned,  but  that  sounds  less  like  a  marriage  and  more  like  a  business  partnership.  Maybe  there  are  business  tools  that  would  be  useful.
236612	If  you  already  filed  the  DC  return,  you  can  try  and  wait  with  filing  the  NJ  return  until  you  get  the  answer  from  DC.    You  can  file  an  extension  request  with  the  NJ  division  of  taxation  here.  Or,  you  can  file  without  claiming  the  credit,  and  worst  case  amend  later  and  claim  it  if  DC  refuse  to  refund.  I  find  it  highly  unlikely  that  DC  will  decide  that  a  person  staying  for  a  couple  of  months  over  the  year  in  hotels  will  count  as  a  resident.
473641	This  is  fraud  and  could  lead  to  jail  time.  The  vast  majority  of  people  cannot  obtain  such  loans  without  collateral  and  one  would  have  to  have  a  healthy  income  and  good  credit  to  obtain  that  kind  of  loan  to  purchase  something  secured  by  a  valuable  asset,  such  as  a  home.  Has  this  been  done  before?    Yes,  despite  it  being  the  US,  you  may  find  this  article  interesting.          Hopefully,  you  see  how  the  intent  of  this  hypothetical  situation  is  stealing.
415408	This  is  called  a  fraudulent  conveyance  because  its  purpose  is  to  prevent  a  creditor  from  getting  repaid.  It  is  subject  to  claw  back  under  US  law,  which  is  a  fancy  way  of  saying  that  your  friend  will  have  to  pay  the  bank  back.  Most  jurisdictions  have  similar  laws.  It  is  probably  a  crime  as  well,  but  that  varies  by  jurisdiction.
230467	Note  that  in  the  UK  at  least  this  scam  -  not  so  dissimilar  from  what  you  propose  -  seems  be  perfectly  legal  behaviour:  Evidence  to  date  is  that  both  of  you  can  expect  to  walk  away  without  much  consequence.
58035	This  sounds  like  a  crazy  idea,  but  in  reality  people  don't  make  the  wisest  decisions  when  considering  bankruptcy  in  Australia.    My  suggestion  would  be  to  get  some  advice  from  an  insolvency  specialist.
58426	Investing  in  an  existing  company  is  almost  like  buying  a  house,  or  even  becoming  an  "Angel  investor"  in  a  start-up.  Before  you  start  the  process,  decide  how  much  you  want  to  be  involved  in  the  day-to-day  and  which  industries  you  would  feel  most  comfortable  in.    The  latter  is  an  important  consideration  since  you  would  have  to  know  sufficient  about  the  industry  in  order  to  evaluate  the  quality  of  your  prospective  investment.  Searching  for  a  suitable  business  is  a  time-consuming  process:  The  guidance  for  evaluating  any  company  has  been  answered  in  another  question,  so  I'll  simply  link.  Most  business  owners  are  looking  to  their  businesses  to  provide  them  a  pension,  so  they  often  look  to  sell  around  retirement  age.    Buying  such  a  business  is  tricky  -  you  may  be  assisting  the  next  generation  to  finance  the  purchase  which  can  have  it's  own  struggles.  Ideally  you'll  be  looking  for  a  young(ish)  company  with  proven  sales  and  which  is  looking  to  finance  growth  in  an  optimal  way.    Such  a  company  may  have  many  options  for  raising  capital  so  you'll  be  competing  to  invest.  As  to  whether  or  not  it's  a  good  idea...    KFC  only  became  a  household  name  and  global  franchise  after  Pete  Harman  joined  Harland  Sanders  as  a  partner.    Richard  and  Maurice  McDonald  may  have  founded  McDonald's  but  it  was  Ray  Kroc  who  made  it  a  success.  New  partners  bring  in  new  ideas  and  fresh  energy  which  the  original  entrepreneurs  may  have  lost  during  the  difficulties  of  starting  out.  But  that  goes  back  to  my  first  query;  just  how  much  do  you  want  to  get  involved?
436505	The  short  answer  is  yes  you  probably  can  take  the  deduction  for  a  home  office  because  the  space  is  used  exclusively  and  you  are  working  there  for  the  convenience  of  your  employer  if  you  don't  have  a  desk  at  your  employers  office.  The  long  answer  is  that  it  may  not  be  worth  it  to  take  the  home  office  deduction  as  an  employee.  You're  deduction  is  subject  to  a  2%  AGI  floor.  You  can  only  deduct  a  percentage  of  your  rent  or  the  depreciation  on  your  home.  A  quick  and  dirty  example  if  you  make  $75k/year,  rent  a  1200  sqft  2  bedroom  apartment  for  $1000/month  and  use  one  bedroom  (120  sqft)  regularly  and  exclusively  for  your  employer.  You  can  deduct  10%  (120sqft/1200sqft)  of  the  $12000  ($1000*12  months  (assumes  your  situation  didn't  change))  in  rent  or  $1200.  However  because  you  are  an  employee  you  are  subject  to  the  2%  AGI  floor  so  you  can  deduct  $1200-$1500  (75000*.02  (salary  *  2%  floor))  =  -300  so  in  order  to  deduct  the  first  dollar  you  need  an  additional  $300  worth  of  deductible  expenses.    Depending  on  your  situation  it  may  or  may  not  be  worth  it  to  take  the  home  office  deduction  even  if  you  qualify  for  it.
245122	Talk  to  a  tax  professional.  The  IRS  really  doesn't  like  the  deduction,  and  it's  a  concept  (like  independent  contractors)  that  is  often  not  done  properly.  You  need  to,  at  a  minimum,  have  records,  including  timestamped  photographs,  proving  that:  Remember,  documentation  is  key,  and  must  be  filed  and  accessible  for  a  number  of  years.  Poor  record  keeping  will  cost  you  dearly,  and  the  cost  of  keeping  those  records  is  something  that  you  need  to  weigh  against  the  benefit.
124507	The  general  rule  is:  Generally,  in  order  to  claim  a  business  deduction  for  your  home,  you  must  use  part  of  your  home  exclusively  and  regularly:  Exclusively  seems  to  be  the  toughest  standard  and  I  do  not  know  exactly  how  strict  the  IRS's  interpretation  is.  Working  in  your  living  room  where  you  regularly  watch  TV  and  have  people  over  on  the  weekends  would  seem  to  fail  that  test.  A  separate  room  with  your  computer  in  it  would  pass  it.  If  it  was  your  only  computer  and  you  regularly  played  online  games  with  it,  that  would  seem  to  be  a  grey  area.    The  IRA  booklet  covering  this  area  is  here  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p587.pdf  I  know  people  that  have  rented  rooms  in  other  places  or  made  use  of  rental  offices  for  this  purpose.
582955	90%  sounds  like  "principal  place  of  business"  but  check  these  IRS  resources  to  make  sure.
287693	I'll  take  an  alternate  route:  honesty  +  humor.  Say  something  like  this  with  a  smile  and  a  laugh,  like  you  know  they're  crazy,  but  they  maybe  don't  know  it  yet.  "Are  you  crazy?  Co-signing  a  loan  can  put  us  both  in  a  lot  of  potential  danger.  First,  you  shouldn't  get  a  loan  that  you  can't  afford/attain  on  your  own,  and  second,  I'd  be  crazy  to  agree  to  be  liable  for  a  loan  that  someone  else  can't  get  on  their  own.  You  want  something  bad  enough,  you  get  your  credit  rating  in  order,  or  you  save  up  the  money  -  that's  how  I  bought  (my  car/house/trip  to  Geneva).  I'd  be  happy  to  point  you  in  the  right  direction  if  you  want  to  put  a  plan  together."  You're  offering  help,  but  not  the  kind  that  puts  you  in  danger.  Declining  to  co-sign  a  loan  can't  damage  your  relationship  with  this  person  as  much  as  failure  to  pay  will.
161676	I  really  don't  feel  co-signing  this  loan  is  in  the  best  interests  of  either  of  us.    Lets  talk  about  the  amount  of  money  you  need  and  perhaps  I  can  assist  you  in  another  way.  I  would  be  honest  and  tell  them  it  isn't  a  good  deal  for  anybody,  especially  not  me.    I  would  then  offer  an  alternative  "loan"  of  some  amount  of  money  to  help  them  get  financing  on  their  own.    The  key  here  is  the  "loan"  I  offer  is  really  a  gift  and  should  it  ever  be  returned  I  would  be  floored  and  overjoyed.    I  wouldn't  give  more  than  I  can  afford  to  not  have.  Part  of  why  I'd  be  honest  to  spread  the  good  word  about  responsible  money  handling.    Co-signed  loans  (and  many  loans  themselves)  probably  aren't  good  financial  policy  if  not  a  life  &  death  or  emergency  situation.    If  they  get  mad  at  me  it  won't  matter  too  much  because  they  are  family  and  that  won't  change.
336093	I  have  been  in  this  situation  and  I  essentially  went  for  the  truthful  answer.    I  first  explained  that  co-signing  for  a  loan  wasn't  just  vouching  for  the  person,  which  I  certainly  would  do,  but  it  was  putting  my  name  on  the  loan  and  making  me  the  person  they  loan  company  would  go  after  if  a  payment  was  ever  missed.  Then  I  explained  that  even  within  married  couples,  money  can  be  a  major  source  of  strife  and  fights,  it  would  be  even  worse  for  someone  not  quite  as  close  like  a  family  member  or  friend.  Essentially  I  wouldn't  want  to  risk  my  relationship  with  a  good  friend  or  family  member  over  some  financial  matter.
121866	I'm  going  to  be  buying  a  house  /  car  /  home  theater  system  in  the  next  few  months,  and  this  loan  would  show  up  on  my  credit  report  and  negatively  impact  my  score,  making  me  unable  to  get  the  financing  that  I'll  need.
48087	Simple  and  straight-forward.    "I'm  sorry  but  I  don't  co-sign  loans.    I've  heard  horror  stories  (or  had  bad  experiences  if  you  actually  have)  about  these  things  going  bad  and  ruining  friendships.    Your  friendship  is  more  important  to  me  than  you  getting  this  car/stereo/whatever."      You  could  go  on  to  explain  that  it's  not  necessarily  a  lack  of  trust  in  them,  but  the  problem  could  be  cause  by  things  beyond  either  of  your  control.    Let's  say  there's  an  error  at  the  bank  and  his  payment  doesn't  get  processed  on  time  and  it  hits  your  credit  score.    Next  thing  that  happens  is  your  credit  card  company  sees  the  change  in  your  score  and  jacks  up  the  rate  on  your  card.      Neither  of  you  did  anything  wrong,  but  now  instead  of  him  just  fighting  with  the  bank  about  the  payment  not  getting  processed  on  time,  you  are  having  to  fight  with  your  credit  card  company.    You  are  both  in  an  awkward  situation.    You  might  get  pissed  at  him  (you  could  make  this  out  to  be  a  failing  on  your  part)  even  though  it  wasn't  his  fault.    Or  he  might  be  embarassed  to  come  around  even  though  you  know  it  wasn't  his  fault  and  aren't  pissed  at  him.
301817	My  reply  would  be  a  serious,  "Oh  my  word!  I  was  going  to  ask  you  the  same  thing!....guess  that's  a  no  from  you".  I'd  turn  it  back  to  them  and  let  them  be  confused  and  think..gee..I  guess  she's  not  that  much  better  off  than  me.  Awkward  but  that's  what  I'd  say.
131842	Oh,  how  about  something  like  "I'd  rather  not.  It  exposes  me  to  more      financial  liability  than  I  want.  If      you  were  in  the  hospital,  or  some      emergency  like  that,  it  might  be      different,  but..."
380053	'If  i  co-sign  that  makes  me  100%  liable  if  for  any  reason  you  can't  or  won't  pay.    Also  this  shows  up  on  a  credit  report  just  like  it's  my  debt.    This  limits  the  amount  i  can  borrow  for  any  reason.    I  don't  want  to  take  on  your  debt,  that's  your  business  and  i  don't  want  to  make  it  mine'.
230074	This  is  a  real  difficult  situation  and  I  think  the  correct  way  to  proceed  here  is  to  be  honest  and  straightforward.
594175	No,  I  don't  mix  business  and  personal  affairs.
120986	I  think  this  is  off  topic,  but  here  is  a  stab:  So  these  are  cashless.    It  could  be  a  way  to  smooth  out  the  harsh  reality  of  capitalism  (I  overproduced  my  product,  I  have  more  capacity  than  I  can  sell)  and  I  can  trade  those  good  to  other  capitalists  who  similarly  poorly  planned  production  or  capacity.  Therefore  the  market  for  a  system  like  is  limited  to  businesses  that  do  not  plan  well.    Business  that  plan  production  or  capacity  to  levels  they  can  already  sell  for  cash  do  not  need  a  private  system  to  offload  goods.  Alternatives  to  such  a  system  include:  (I  don't  know  how  many  businesses  are  really  in  this  over  production  /  over  capacity  state.    If  my  assumption  that  it  isn't  many  is  wrong,  my  answer  is  garbage.)  This  is  a  bartering  system  with  a  brokerage.    I  think  we  have  historically  found  that  common  currencies  create  more  trade  and  economic  activity  because  the  value  of  the  note  in  your  pocket,  which  is  the  same  type  of  note  in  my  pocket,  is  common  and  understood.    Exchange  rates  typically  slow  down  trade.    (There  are  many  other  reasons  to  have  different  currency  or  notes  on  a  global  sale,  but  the  exchange  certainly  is  a  hurdle  to  clear.)  This  brokerage  is  essentially  adding  a  new  currency  (in  a  grand  metaphor).    And  that  new  currency  is  only  spendable  on  their  brokerage,  which  is  of  limited  use  to  society  as  a  whole,  assuming  that  society  as  a  whole  isn't  a  participating  member  of  that  brokerage.  I  can't  really  think  of  why  this  type  of  exchange  is  better  than  the  current  system  we  have  now.    I  wouldn't  invest  in  this  as  a  business,  or  invest  in  this  as  a  person  looking  for  opportunity.
345475	In  any  country,  individuals  (and  shops)  can  reject  any  form  of  payment  that  is  not  Legal  Tender  -  defined  by  law  as  a  payment  form  that  must  be  accepted.  Shops  are  typically  more  generous,  because  they  want  to  do  business  with  you,  but  individuals  are  in  a  different  position.  In  France,  only  official  coins  and  bills  are  declared  as  Legal  Tender  (so  if  they  don't  want  to,  individuals  don't  even  need  to  accept  bank  transfers).  This  is  for  doubts  you  need  to  pay.  In  addition,  as  you  are  not  forced  to  do  business  with  them,  people  and  shops  can  require  whatever  they  feel  like  to  require  -  if  you  want  to  buy  their  car,  they  can  ask  you  to  stand  on  your  head  and  spit  coins,  and  if  you  don't  like  it,  they  don't  sell  to  you.  (They  won't  do  much  business  then,  probably)
425559	It's  a  little  unusual,  but  I  don't  think  the  financial  terms  are  completely  unreasonable  on  their  face.  What  you  describe  is  similar  to  an  interest-only  loan,  where  you  make  payments  that  only  cover  the  interest  due  each  month,  and  the  entire  principal  is  due  as  a  single  "balloon  payment"  on  a  specified  date  (in  this  case,  the  date  on  which  the  condo  is  sold).    Your  monthly  payment  of  $500  on  a  principal  of  $115K  is  equivalent  to  an  annual  interest  rate  of  5.22%,  which  at  least  is  not  completely  usurious.    With  a  traditional  mortgage  you  might  pay  a  rate  as  low  as  3%,  if  you  had  sufficient  income  and  excellent  credit  -  but  I  don't  know,  from  what  you've  said,  whether  that's  the  case.    Did  you  make  the  current  arrangement  because  you  were  unable  to  get  a  loan  from  a  bank?  The  main  difference  here  is  that  instead  of  the  balloon  payment  being  a  fixed  $115K,  it's  "75%  of  the  gross  proceeds  of  the  sale".    If  the  condo  eventually  sells  for  $155K,  that  would  be  $116,250,  so  that's  slightly  advantageous  to  them  (assuming  that  "gross  proceeds"  means  "before  deducting  commissions  for  either  the  buyers'  or  sellers'  realtors  or  any  other  costs  of  the  sale"),  and  thus  slightly  disadvantageous  to  you.    If  the  condo  appreciates  in  value,  that's  more  of  a  win  for  them  and  more  of  a  relative  loss  for  you.    But  it's  also  possible  that  the  value  of  the  condo  goes  down,  in  which  case  this  arrangement  is  better  for  you  than  a  fixed  balloon  payment.    So  this  deal  does  prevent  you  from  getting  a  larger  share  of  any  gains  in  the  value  of  the  property,  but  it  also  helps  insulate  you  from  any  losses.    That's  important  to  keep  in  mind.  There's  also  the  issue  of  needing  their  consent  to  sell.    That's  potentially  problematic  -  usually  in  a  joint  ownership  scheme,  either  owner  has  the  right  to  demand  to  be  bought  out  or  to  force  a  sale.    I  guess  it  depends  on  whether  you  think  your  parents  would  be  likely  to  consent  under  reasonable  circumstances,  or  to  insist  on  holding  the  property  against  your  best  interests.  It's  true  that  you  aren't  building  equity  with  this  arrangement,  and  if  you  thought  you  were,  you  are  mistaken  or  misled.    But  let's  compare  it  with  other  options.  If  you  would  qualify  for  a  traditional  30-year  fixed  mortgage  at  3%,  your  monthly  payment  would  be  slightly  lower  ($484),  and  you  would  be  building  some  equity  because  your  payments  would  reduce  the  principal  as  well  as  paying  the  interest.    But  a  30-year  loan  builds  equity  very  slowly  at  first  -  after  7  years  you'd  have  only  about  $20,000  in  principal  paid  down.  If  we  assume  that  5.2%  represents  the  interest  rate  you'd  otherwise  pay  based  on  your  creditworthiness,  then  your  monthly  payment  would  be  $631.    So  compared  to  that,  you  have  an  extra  $130  per  month  that  you  can  save  or  invest  in  whatever  you  want  -  you're  not  forced  to  invest  it  in  your  house.  Note  that  in  either  case  you'd  still  be  paying  the  condo  fees,  property  taxes,  insurance,  and  maintenance  yourself.    So  we  might  as  well  eliminate  those  from  consideration.      It  might  be  a  good  idea  to  find  out  what  other  options  you  would  have  -  perhaps  try  to  get  an  interest  rate  quote  on  a  traditional  mortgage  from  a  bank,  based  on  your  income  and  credit  history.    Then  you  can  decide  what  to  do,  taking  into  account:  your  financial  situation;  how  much  of  a  monthly  payment  could  you  afford?  your  relationship  with  your  parents;  are  they  likely  to  be  reasonable  about  renegotiating?    Do  they  in  general  tend  to  respect  your  wishes?    Would  it  harm  your  relationship  if  you  tried  to  get  out  of  the  deal,  and  how  important  is  that  to  you?  To  what  extent  do  you  actually  want  to  pay  for  equity  in  this  property?  Do  you  really  believe  it's  a  good  investment,  and  have  evidence  to  support  that?      Your  options  include:  Try  to  renegotiate  the  terms  of  the  loan  from  your  parents  Try  to  "refinance"  the  loan,  by  getting  a  loan  from  a  bank  and  paying  off  some  agreed-upon  amount  of  principal  to  your  parents  Try  to  force  the  sale  of  the  condo  and  move  to  another  house,  financing  it  some  other  way  Consult  a  lawyer  as  to  whether  your  agreement  with  your  parents  is  legally  enforceable.    For  instance,  do  they  have  a  lien  on  the  property?
487438	Ripped  off  may  be  too  strong  as  it  implies  intent  -  I'm  hopeful  it's  just  bad  logic  or  terminology.      I  would  say  better  agreements  would  be:  Borrowing  money  from  family/friends  is  always  risky.    If  you  and  your  parents  are  comfortable  with  the  situation  and  can  reliably  keep  records  of  how  much  is  owed  at  any  given  time  (and  how  much  of  the  $500/mo  is  interest)  then  the  loan  might  be  a  good  option.    If  not,  and  your  parents  don't  need  the  income  stream  from  the  loan,  then  I  would  recommend  the  second  option  since  it's  much  cleaner.  In  any  case,  make  sure  everything  is  in  writing  and  the  proper  legal  procedures  are  followed  (just  as  if  you  had  borrowed  the  money  from  a  bank).  That  means  either  filing  a  mortgage  with  the  county  for  option  1  or  having  both  parties  on  the  deed,  and  having  the  ownership  percentages  in  writing.
300297	To  expand  on  what  @fishinear  and  some  others  are  saying:    The  only  way  to  look  at  it  is  that  the  parents  have  invested,  because  the  parents  get  a  %  of  the  property  in  the  end,  rather  than  the  original  loan  amount  plus  interest.    It  is  investment;  it  is  not  a  loan  of  any  kind.    One  way  to  understand  this  is  to  imagine  that  after  20  years,  the  property  triples  in  value  (or  halves  in  value).    The  parents  participate  as  if  they  had  invested  in  75%  ownership  of  the  property  and  the  OP  as  if  25%  ownership  of  the  property.  Note  that  with  a  loan,  there  is  a  (potentially  changing)  outstanding  loan  balance,  that  could  be  paid  to  end  the  loan  (to  pay  off  the  loan),  and  there  is  an  agreed  upon  an  interest  rate  that  is  computed  on  the  outstanding  balance  —  none  of  those  apply  to  this  situation;  further  with  a  loan  there  is  no  %  of  the  property:  though  the  property  may  be  used  to  secure  the  loan,  that  isn't  ownership.  Basically,  since  the  situation  bears  none  of  the  qualities  of  a  loan,  and  yet  does  bear  the  qualities  of  investment,  the  parents  have  bought  a  %  ownership  of  the  property.  The  parents  have  invested  in  75%  of  the  real  estate,  and  the  OP  is  renting  that  75%  from  them  for:  The  total  rent  the  OP  is  paying  the  parents  for  their  75%  of  the  property  is  then  (at  least)  $1012.50/mo,    A  rental  rate  of  $1012.50/mo  for  75%  of  the  property  equates  to  a  rental  price  of  $1350/mo  for  the  whole  property.  This  arrangement  is  only  fair  to  both  parties  when  the  fair-market  rental  value  of  the  whole  property  is  $1350/mo;  it  is  unfair  to  the  OP  when  the  fair-market  rental  value  of  property  is  less,  and  unfair  to  the  parents  when  the  fair-market  rental  value  of  property  is  more.      Of  course,  the  fair-market  rental  value  of  the  property  is  variable  over  time,  so  the  overall  fairness  would  need  to  understand  rental  values  over  time.  I  feel  like  this  isn't  actually  a  loan  if  I  can  never  build  more  equity  in  the  condo.  Am  I  missing  something?  No,  it  isn't  a  loan.    You  and  your  parents  are  co-investing  in  real  estate.    Further,  you  are  renting  their  portion  of  the  investment  from  them.  For  comparison,  with  a  loan  you  have  100%  ownership  in  the  property  from  the  start,  so  you,  the  owner,  would  see  all  the  upside/downside  as  the  property  valuation  changes  over  time  whether  the  loan  is  paid  off  or  not.  The  borrower  owes  the  loan  balance  (and  interest)  not  some  %  of  the  property.    A  loan  may  be  secured  by  the  property  (using  a  lien)  but  that  is  quite  different  from  ownership.    Typically,  a  loan  has  a  payment  schedule  setup  to  reduce  the  loan  balance  (steadily)  over  time  so  that  you  eventually  pay  it  off.    With  a  loan  you  gain  equity  %  —  the  amount  you  own  outright,  free  &  clear  —  in  two  ways,  (1)  by  gradually  paying  off  the  loan  over  time  so  the  unencumbered  portion  of  the  property  grows,  and  (2)  if  the  valuation  of  the  property  increases  over  time  that  gain  in  equity  %  is  yours  (not  the  lenders).    However  note  that  the  legal  ownership  is  all  100%  yours  from  the  start.  Are  my  parents  ripping  me  off  with  this  deal  that  doesn't  allow  me  to  build  my  equity  in  my  home?  You  can  evaluate  whether  you  are  being  ripped  off  by  comparing  the  $1350/mo  rate  to  the  potential  rental  rate  for  the  property  over  time  (which  will  be  a  range  or  curve,  and  there  are  real  estate  websites  (like  zillow.com  or  redfin.com,  others)  to  help  estimate  what  fair-market  rent  might  be).  Are  there  similar  deals  like  this...?    A  straight-forward  loan  would  have  the  borrower  with  100%  legal  ownership  from  the  start,  just  that  the  property  secures  the  loan.    Whereas  with  co-investment  there  is  a  division  of  ownership  %  that  is  fixed  from  the  start.      It  is  unusual  to  have  both  investment  and  loan  at  the  same  time  where  they  are  setup  for  gradual  change  between  them.    (Investment  and  loan  can  certainly  be  done  together  but  would  usually  be  done  as  completely  separate  contracts,  one  loan,  one  investment  with  no  adjustment  between  the  two  over  time.)  To  do  both  investment  and  loan  would  be  unusual  but  certainly  be  possible,  I  would  imagine;  however  that  is  not  the  case  here  as  being  described.    I  am  not  familiar  with  contracts  that  do  both  so  as  to  take  over  the  equity/ownership/investment  over  time  while  also  reducing  loan  balance.    Perhaps  some  forms  of  rent-to-own  work  that  way,  something  to  look  into  —  still,  usually  rent-to-own  means  that  until  the  renter  owns  it  100%,  the  landlord  owns  100%,  rather  than  a  gradual  %  transfer  over  time  (gradual  transfer  would  imply  co-ownership  for  a  long  time,  something  that  most  landlords  would  be  reluctant  to  do).      Transfer  of  any  particular  %  of  real  estate  ownership  typically  requires  filing  documents  with  the  county  and  may  incur  fees.    I  am  not  aware  of  counties  that  allow  gradual  %  transfer  with  one  single  filing.    Still,  the  courts  may  honor  a  contract  that  does  such  gradual  transfer  outside  of  county  filings.  If  so,  what  should  I  do?  Explain  the  situation  to  your  parents,  and,  in  particular,  however  far  out  of  balance  the  rental  rate  may  be.    Decide  for  yourself  if  you  want  to  rent  vs.  buy,  and  where  (that  property  or  some  other).    If  your  parents  are  fair  people,  they  should  be  open  to  negotiation.    If  not,  you  might  need  a  lawyer.      I  suspect  that  a  lawyer  would  be  able  to  find  several  issues  with  which  to  challenge  the  contract.  The  other  terms  are  important  as  well,  namely  gross  vs.  net  proceeds  (as  others  point  out)  because  selling  a  property  costs  a  %  to  real  estate  agents  and  possibly  some  taxes  as  well.  And  as  the  others  have  pointed  out,  if  the  property  ultimately  looses  value,  that  could  be  factored  in  as  well.  It  is  immaterial  to  judging  the  fairness  of  this  particular  situation  whether  getting  a  bank  loan  would  be  preferable  to  renting  75%  from  the  parents.    Further,  loan  interest  rates  don't  factor  into  the  fairness  of  this  rental  situation  (but  of  course  interest  rates  do  factor  into  identifying  the  better  of  various  methods  of  investment  and  methods  of  securing  a  place  to  live,  e.g.  rent  vs.  buy).  Contributed  by  @Scott:  If  your  parents  view  this  as  an  investment  arrangement  as  described,  then  you  need  to  clarify  with  them  if  the  payments  being  made  to  them  are  considered  a  "buy  out"  of  their  share.  This  would  allow  you  to  gain  the  equity  you  seek  from  the  arrangement.  @Scott:  Terms  would  have  to  be  (or  have  been)  declared  to  that  effect;  this  would  involve  specifying  some  schedule  and/or  rates.    It  would  have  to  be  negotiated;  this  it  is  not  something  that  could  go  assumed  or  unstated.    --  Erik
162817	First,  this  was  never  an  arrangement  for  you  to  build  equity,  this  was  an  arrangement  for  them  to  speculate  on  another  house  under  the  guise  of  teaching  you  a  life  lesson  like  responsibility  or  something  contrived.  The  only  way  you  profit  from  this  is  if  the  value  of  the  house  goes  up  and  you  sell  it.  You  get  25%  of  the  proceeds,  maybe.  If  this  was  an  equitable  arrangement  then  they  would  be  paying  75%  of  the  property  taxes  and  a  little  more  for  your  maintenance  efforts.
95320	You  are  getting  totally  hosed  mate.  Assume  you  live  in  the  house  for  ten  years,  can  get  a  normal  30  year  mortgage  and  house  prices  average  at  3%  annually  You  could  get  a  mortgage  at  3.8%  so  your  monthly  payment  would  be  $560  a  month.    $60  a  month  difference  over  10  year  is  $7200  Because  you  are  paying  down  on  a    conventional  mortgage  you  would  owe  93500  after  10  years.    On  top  of  that  the  house  would  have  appreciated  by  $47000.    You  would  have  to  give  you  parents  $35500  of  that.    So  by  avoiding  a  normal  loan  it's  costing  you  an  extra  $49000.
574432	If  I  understand  you  situation  correctly,  then  the  accepted  answer  is  extremely  misleading  and  incorrect.  Your  arrangement  with  your  parents  is  definitely  unreasonable.  It  is  definitely  not  "similar  to  an  interest-only  loan".  In  an  interest-only  loan,  like  you  can  get  from  a  bank,  you  will  loan  a  sum  of  money,  which  you  are  expected  to  pay  back  at  a  certain  time  in  the  future,  or  when  you  sell  the  condo.  But  you  pay  back  the  original  sum,  not  the  value  of  property  at  selling  time.  For  the  access  to  the  money  you  pay  an  interest  to  the  bank.  The  bank  gets  their  profits  from  the  interest.  The  property  only  serves  as  collateral  in  case  you  are  not  able  to  make  your  interest  payments.    Another  way  to  view  it,  is  that  your  parent  bought  (a  share  of)  your  condo  for  investment  reasons.  In  that  case,  they  would  expect  to  get  their  profits  from  the  increase  of  the  value  of  the  property  over  time.  That  looks  most  like  your  situation.  Granted,  that  is  more  risky  for  them,  but  that  is  what  they  choose  to  sign  up  for.  But  in  that  case  it  is  not  reasonable  to  charge  your  for  interest  as  well,  because  that  would  mean  they  would  get  double  profits.  So  how  does  the  $500  monthly  payment  fit  in?  If  it  is  interest,  then  it  would  work  out  to  a  yearly  interest  of  about  5.2%.  Where  I  live,  that  would  nowadays  be  extremely  high  even  for  an  interest-only  mortgage  from  a  bank.  But  I  don't  live  in  the  USA,  so  don't  know  whether  that  is  true  there.  I  think  in  your  situation,  the  $500  can  only  be  seen  as  rent.  Whether  that  is  reasonable  for  your  situation  I  cannot  judge  from  here.  It  should  be  75%  of  a  reasonable  rent  for  a  condo  like  that.  But  in  that  case,  your  parents  should  also  stand  for  75%  of  the  maintenance  costs  of  the  property,  which  you  don't  mention,  and  most  of  the  property  taxes  and  insurance  fees.  In  short,  no  it  is  not  a  reasonable  arrangement.  You  would  be  better  of  trying  to  get  a  morgage  from  the  bank,  and  buy  out  your  parents  with  it.
101816	Yes,  you  are  getting  shafted.  In  the  end,  you  will  have  paid  the  full  price  of  the  condo,  but  still  own  only  25%  of  it.  Your  parents'  stake  in  the  home  should  decrease  as  you  repay  the  loan.  The  way  it  is  now,  they're  getting  75%  of  your  condo  for  free!
80840	Talk  to  your  parents,  and  find  out  if  you  are  reducing  the  debt  or  not.    Find  buyers,  sell  the  place  now  and  get  out  the  deal.    Of  course  you  will  have  to  wait  to  get  a  good  price  on  it.    Short  term  you  haven't  lost  that  much,  but  long  term  you  will.  Take  your  25%,  and  use  it  as  a  down  payment  on  a  regular  bank  mortgage.    Lesson  learned  move  on.
73918	First,  I  don't  think  your  parents  are  ripping  you  off,  but  you  should  get  your  agreement  in  writing.  The  fact  that  you  never  own  more  than  25%  doesn't  matter.  If  the  condo's  value  is  increasing,  you  are  in  fact  building  equity.  Your  share  of  the  equity  just  doesn't  increase,  but  it  doesn't  decrease  either.  For  example,  if  the  condo  is  worth  $300,000  now,  you  have  $75,000  in  equity.  Of  course  if  the  value  is  decreasing,  so  is  your  equity.  If  you  are  paying  $500/month  in  interest  (as  OP  clarified  above),  and  you  don't  have  a  written  agreement,  you  are  probably  unable  to  claim  that  payment  as  mortgage  interest  if  you  itemize  your  deductions  on  U.S.  federal  or  state  tax  returns,  thus  you  may  be  losing  out  on  a  legal  tax  deduction  (assuming  you  earn  enough  to  itemize).  They  will  need  to  give  you  each  year  the  proper  IRS  form  for  mortgage  interest  (Form  1098).  And,  they  have  to  claim  the  $500/month  as  interest  income  on  their  tax  returns.  Having  a  written  and  signed  contract  eliminates  confusion  and  potential  for  heartbreaking  misunderstanding  the  future--and  it  sounds  like  you  are  already  experiencing  some  doubt  and  confusion  now.  Your  rate  seems  within  market  rates  for  an  interest-only  loan.  Let's  say  you  wanted  to  buy  out  your  parents'  share  of  the  condo  right  now.  Would  you  pay  $115,000  or  would  you  have  to  get  an  appraisal  to  find  out  what  the  condo  is  worth  now?  If  you  can't  answer  that  question,  you  need  to  get  that  in  writing  so  that  you  won't  have  an  argument  over  it  someday.  If  the  condo  has  appreciated  significantly  and  all  you  have  to  pay  is  the  $115,000,  then  that's  a  sweet  deal  for  you,  because  you'd  be  buying  out  a  much  more  valuable  property  for  much  less  than  it's  worth.  If  that  is  the  agreement,  and  the  property  is  appreciating  (no  guarantee,  especially  with  condos),  then  you  are  essentially  building  equity.  If  the  property  is  declining  in  value  and  you  do  wish  to  sell  it,  then  you  won't  have  to  pay  $115,000;  they'll  just  end  up  with  their  75%  share,  which  will  be  less  than  the  $115K  they  invested.  Both  of  you  would  lose  some  of  your  investment,  but  you  would  have  had  all  the  benefits  of  living  in  a  nice  condo  all  those  years  and  they  wouldn't.  They  are  definitely  taking  more  risk  than  you  are.  Second,  if  you  had  $40,000  cash  saved  up,  your  parents  probably  raised  you  with  some  good  financial  sense  and  work  ethic,  so  I'm  optimistic  they  have  good  intentions  for  your  future.  Operate  from  that  frame  of  mind  when  you  go  to  ask  for  a  written  agreement.  Next,  read  up  about  Equity  Share  Agreements.  There  are  many  models  that  will  help  inform  your  decisions.  But,  you  should  engage  a  real  estate  lawyer  to  help  you  draw  up  a  fair  agreement  for  both  parties.    I  was  in  an  equity  share  agreement  for  my  first  townhouse.  It's  a  common  practice,  and  it  won't  cost  all  that  much  to  get  one  created.  It's  worth  the  money  to  get  it  done  properly.
307276	No  It's  not  a  loan.  It's  an  equity  investment.  Think  of  it  as  a  business.  The  parents  bought  75%  of  the  equity  with  $115K,  and  are  entitled  to  75%  of  the  sale  proceeds,  should  you  someday  liquidate  the  business  (i.e.  selling  the  house).  The  $500  per  month  is  just  business  revenue  and  is  paid  to  your  parents  as  a  dividend.  Imagine  you  rent  it  out  to  your  self  and  charge  a  $666.66  rent  -  you  take  25%  of  that  back  and  give  your  parents  the  rest.  Like  any  equity  investment,  the  risk  for  them  is  that  if  the  value  of  the  house  goes  down,  they  will  have  to  shoulder  the  loss.    And  you  are  right,  there  is  no  way  to  build  equity.  You  already  sold  that  to  your  parents.
93189	Actually  if  you  look  at  a  loan  for  $115,000  over  30  years  at  current  interest  rates  you  would  have  a  payment  of  about  $500  a  month.  I  would  argue  your  $500  monthly  payments  are  building  equity  the  same  way  a  loan  repayment  schedule  would.  Is  your  agreement  in  writing?  If  it  is,  there's  nothing  you  can  do  unless  they  agree.  If  it's  not  then  write  up  a  contract  for  a  $115k  loan  that  you  will  pay  back  over  30  years  at  $500  a  month  with  the  amortization  table.  That  will  show  how  much  equity  you're  building  over  time.  (It's  not  much  the  first  10  years!)  Note  that  some  states  require  real  estate  contract  to  be  in  writing  or  else  they  are  voidable  by  either  party.  Whatever  you  do,  get  something  in  writing  or  you'll  probably  either  end  up  in  court  or  feeling  bitter  for  the  next  few  decades.
423398	The  time  to  have  looked  into  this  is  before  you  bought  the  condo,  not  now.  You  are  presumably  an  adult.  Your  parents  have  apparently  made  it  possible  for  you  to  have  a  roof  of  your  own  over  your  head  for  what  is  probably  below  rental  rates  (but  I  don't  know  your  area,  so  can't  say).  From  their  point  of  view,  they  may  have  been  doing  you  a  favor,  while  giving  themselves  an  investment  opportunity.  What  would  they  be  doing  with  that  money  otherwise,  and  at  a  higher  or  lower  rate  of  return,  and  with  greater  or  lesser  risk?  Where  and  how  would  you  be  living  otherwise?  More  Importantly,  if  you  can't  talk  to  them  about  this  you  have  bigger  problems  than  money.
566184	Basically,  you  have  purchased  25%  of  the  condo  for  $40,000,  and  your  parents  bought  75%  of  the  condo  for  another  $115,000.  We  imagine  for  a  moment  that  it  wasn't  you  who  lived  in  the  condo,  but  some  unrelated  person  paying  rent.    You  are  paying  $7,500  a  year  for  tax  and  fees,  plus  $6,000  a  year,  so  there  is  $13,500  leaving  your  wallet.  If  $15,500  a  year  was  a  reasonable  rent,  then  the  tax  and  fee  would  be  paid  out  of  that,  there  would  be  $8,000  left,  of  which  you  would  get  25%  =  $2,000.  If  you  were  officially  "renting"  it,  you  would  pay  $15,500  a  year,  and  get  $2,000  back,  again  $13,500  leaving  your  wallet.  So  you  are  in  exact  the  same  situation  financially  as  you  would  be  if  you  paid  $15,500  rent.      Question:  Is  $15,500  a  year  or  $1,290  a  month  an  appropriate  rent  for  your  condo?  If  a  neighbour  is  renting  his  condo,  is  he  or  she  paying  $1,290  or  more  or  less?  Could  you  rent  the  same  place  for  the  same  money?  If  $1,290  is  the  correct  rent  then  you  are  fine.  If  the  rent  should  be  lower,  then  you  are  overpaying.  If  the  rent  should  be  higher,  then  you  are  making  money.    Keep  in  mind  that  you  will  also  be  winning  if  rents  go  up  in  the  future.
318929	Are  you  in  the  United  States?  Is  there  some  sort  of  written  agreement  that  the  money  your  parents  paid  into  the  house  is  a  loan  that  will  be  paid  back?    I  assume  the  deed  to  the  home  is  in  your  name,  and  your  parents  do  not  have  a  lien  on  the  property  in  any  way?  In  the  United  States  provided  there  is  no  lien  and  your  parents  are  not  also  on  the  mortgage,  that  home  is  100%  yours.  Now  I  would  argue  you  still  owe  your  parents  money,  but  absent  some  sort  of  contract  it  sounds  like  an  interest  free  loan  that  you'll  pay  back  at  a  rate  of  500$/month.    Your  parents  could  attempt  to  sue  you  and  if  this  happens  I  recommend  you  find  a  real  estate  attorney.  It's  unlikely  that  they  would  win  the  case  since  there's  no  paperwork  and  even  if  there  was  it  is  unlikely  to  hold  up  since  it  so  strongly  favors  them  (  your  parents  ).    Now  if  your  parents  are  listed  on  the  mortgage  or  somehow  have  a  lien  on  the  house,  you  have  a  bigger  issue  as  they  technically  own  (or  at  least  have  an  interest  in)  part  of  the  property  and  when  you  decide  to  sell  the  house  you  would  have  to  involve  them.
536475	yes  and  no  its  definitely  not  charitable  as  they  are  making  money  of  off  you  but  depending  on  the  outside  conditions  if  you  had  to  pay  a  mortgage  on  that  condo  with  only  35k  in  payments  to  start  off  it  would  more  than  likely  exceed  500  dollars  a  month  however  there  would  always  be  a  point  were  the  mortgage  would  end  and  it  dosent  sound  like  thats  going  to  be  the  case  with  you  paying  your  parents  so  it  depends  on  how  long  your  going  to  have  that  condo  and  how  much  mortgage  would  have  been.
115581	I  would  go  see  a  Lawyer  no  matter  what.  It's  a  form  of  a  scam  your  parents  are  doing.  Make  sure  it's  YOUR  name  only  on  the  title  of  the  building  if  it  is,  then  you  have  a  MAJOR  case  against  them.  This  is  a  form  of  Equity  scam,  in  where  you  aren't  really  going  to  make  hardly  any  money.  Once  you  pay  them  that  money  towards  the  loan  legally  their  stake  needs  to  decrease  according  to  what  you  said.  ABSOLUTELY  CONSULT  A  LAWYER!
254303	You're  paying  5.2%  'interest'  on  the  $115K  (500  *  12  /  115,000)  *  100  but  the  amount  you  pay  back  is  not  $115K  but  75%  of  the  property  value  at  sale.  Is  that  right?  A  mortgage  would  have  cost  about  half  that  rate  and  the  balloon  payment  would  have  been  fixed  -  you  would  pay  back  $115K  at  maturity  plus  you  could  have  sold  it  whenever  you  liked  As  Gnasher729  said,  if  you  consider  it  to  be  rent  then  the  situation  looks  different  but  the  point  of  buying  a  house  is  to  avoid  paying  'useless'  rent,  build  equity  and  hopefully  make  a  capital  gain  I'd  speak  to  a  lawyer  &  possibly  an  accountant  (regarding  the  numbers)
165100	It  depends  on  the  selling  price,  but  if  we  can  assume  the  property  will  be  sold  at  a  profit,  they  are  getting  a  pretty  sweet  deal  at  your  expense.  They  are  both  getting  about  5.2%  interest  on  their  money,  plus  the  lion's  share  of  any  property  appreciation.  I  would  say  that  fair  would  be  either  of:
574415	You  are  being  ripped  off  on  several  counts.  1)  40k  is  26%  not  25%.  2)  Why  should  you  pay  them  $500  rent?  they  bought  a  share  of  the  property,  they  should  fund  it  if  they  intend  to  keep  75%  3)  Why  do  you  need  to  pay  them  for  the  75%?  why  dont  they  need  to  pay  you  for  the  25%?  You  are  better  off  getting  a  loan  for  the  75%  and  going  solo  so  you  get  to  buy  equity.
591785	There's  no  reason  for  the  employer  not  to  deduct  the  whole  amount  before  you  leave.  The  FSA  salary  deduction  has  to  be  periodical,  but  it  doesn't  have  to  be  calculated  over  a  year.  It  just  means  that  an  equal  amount  will  be  deducted  from  your  every  paycheck,  and  if  the  employer  (and  you)  know  that  your  last  paycheck  is  on  June  30th  even  before  the  year  starts  -  there's  nothing  to  stop  the  employer  from  calculating  the  periodic  payments  so  that  it  will  cover  your  full  FSA  amount  before  you  leave.  That  is,  of  course,  other  than  mere  convenience  (it  may  be  easier/cheaper  to  just  give  you  the  extra  $1275  than  to  deal  with  the  special  case  deduction  calculation).  This  is  different  from  unexpected  termination/resignation,  where  the  employer  couldn't  have  made  such  an  assumption  and  thus  the  periodic  payments  were  calculated  over  a  year.  See  pub.  969.  The  selection  is  annual  -  the  deductions  are  periodical.
546678	While  you  have  found  a  way  to  possibly  gain  $1275  in  tax  free  income,  you  are  also  risking  $1275  if  you  end  up  not  using  the  money  you  contributed.  You  will  have  to  find  a  way  to  have  that  much  in  medical  expenses  by  your  retirement  date  or  you  will  leave  some  money  in  the  Flexible  Spending  Account.  There  are  risks  you  take  with  these  accounts  (use  it  or  lose  it)  and  risks  the  company  takes  (leave  with  a  deficit  in  the  account).  Many  times  we  get  questions  about  how  to  spend  all  that  the  employee  contributed  before  the  last  day  of  work,  or  the  end  of  the  plan  year.    You  can  play  it  more  fair  by  selecting  the  maximum  amount  per  check  to  be  taken  from  your  pay  check,  then  waiting  until  the  retirement  date  to  decide  how  much  you  will  withdraw  from  the  FSA.  Your  last  day  of  work  is  your  last  day  to  incur  a  medical  expense  but  you  are  given  a  window  to  submit  your  claims  that  extends  beyond  your  last  day  of  work.    I  have  not  personally  heard  of  an  employer  requiring  a  former  employee  to  pay  back  the  money  when  there  is  a    deficit  in  their  FSA.    Remember  people  are  fired,  or  laid  off  with  little  or  no  warning  trapping  their  money  in  a  FSA.  The  fact  that  you  have  the  ability  to  plan  for  this  event  and  considered  your  options,  is  a  great  position  to  be  in.
224665	Can  I  deduct  the  money  that  I  giving  to  my  team  mates  from  the  taxes      that  I  pay?  If  yes,  how  should  I  record  the  transaction?  Why?  Why  are  you  giving  money  to  your  team  mates?  That's  the  most  important  question,  and  any  answer  without  taking  this  into  account  is  not  full.  You  would  probably  have  to  talk  to  a  professional  tax  adviser  (a  CPA/EA  licensed  in  your  state)  about  the  details,  but  in  general  -  you  cannot  deduct  money  you  give  someone  just  because  you  feel  like  it.  Moreover,  it  may  be  subject  to  an  additional  tax  -  the  gift  tax.  PS:  We  don't  have  any  partnership  or  something  similar,  it  is  just      each  of  us  on  his  own.  Assuming  you  want  to  give  your  team  mates  money  because  you  developed  the  project  together  -  then  you  do  in  fact  have  a  partnership.  In  order  to  split  the  income  properly,  you  should  get  a  tax  ID  for  the  partnership,  and  issue  a  1065  and  K-1  for  each  team  mate.  In  most  states,  you  don't  need  to  "register"  a  partnership  with  the  state.  Mere  "lets  do  things  together"  creates  a  partnership.  Otherwise,  if  they  work  for  you  (as  opposed  to  with  you  in  the  case  above),  you  can  treat  it  as  your  own  business  income,  and  pay  your  team  mates  (who  are  now  your  contractors/employees)  accordingly.  Be  careful  here,  because  the  difference  between  contractor  and  employee  in  tax  law  is  significant,  and  you  may  end  up  being  on  the  hook  for  a  lot  of  things  you're  not  aware  of.  Bottom  line,  in  certain  situation  you  cannot  deduct,  in  others  you  can  -  you  have  to  discuss  it  with  a  professional.  Doing  these  things  on  your  own  without  fully  understanding  what  each  term  means  -  is  dangerous,  and  IRS  doesn't  forgive  for  "honest  mistakes".
546277	Note:    This  is  not  professional  tax  advice.    If  you  think  you  need  professional  tax  advice,  find  a  licensed  professional  in  your  local  area.  What  are  the  expected  earnings/year?  US$100?  US$1,000?    US$100,000?    I  would  say  if  this  is  for  US$1,000  or  less  that  registering  an  EIN,  and  consulting  a  CPA  to  file  a  Partnership  Tax  return  is  not  going  to  be  a  profitable  exercise....  all  the  earnings,  perhaps  more,  will  go  to  paying  someone  to  do  (or  help  do)  the  tax  filings.  The  simplest  taxes  are  for  a  business  that  you  completely  own.    Corporations  and  Partnerships  involve  additional  forms  and  get  more  and  more  and  complex,  and  even  more  so  when  it  involves  foreign  participation.    Partnerships  are  often  not  formal  partnerships  but  can  be  more  easily  thought  of  as  independent  businesses  that  each  participants  owns,  that  are  simply  doing  some  business  with  each  other.  Schedule  C  is  the  IRS  form  you  fill  out  for  any  businesses  that  you  own.  On  schedule  C  you  would  list  the  income  from  advertising.    Also  on  schedule  C  there  is  a  place  for  all  of  the  business  expenses,  such  as  ads  that  you  buy,  a  server  that  you  rent,  supplies,  employees,  and  independent  contractors.    Amounts  paid  to  an  independent  contractor  certainly  need  not  be  based  on  hours,  but  could  be  a  fixed  fee,  or  based  on  profit  earned.      Finally,  if  you  pay  anyone  in  the  USA  over  a  certain  amount,  you  have  to  tell  the  IRS  about  that  with  a  Form  1099  at  the  beginning  of  the  next  year,  so  they  can  fill  out  their  taxes.    BUT....  according  to  an  article  in  International  Tax  Blog  you  might  not  have  to  file  Form  1099  with  the  IRS  for  foreign  contractors  if  they  are  not  US  persons  (not  a  US  citizen  or  a  resident  visa  holder).
597401	FINRA  Description  of  Day  Trading  rules  The  rules  adopt  a  new  term  "pattern  day  trader,"  which  includes  any      margin  customer  that  day  trades  (buys  then  sells  or  sells  short  then      buys  the  same  security  on  the  same  day)  four  or  more  times  in  five      business  days,  provided  the  number  of  day  trades  are  more  than  six      percent  of  the  customer's  total  trading  activity  for  that  same      five-day  period.  So,  there's  several  ways  to  avoid  being  labeled  a  pattern  day  trader:
340125	Sorry  but  you  already  provided  the  answer  to  your  own  question.    The  simple  answer  is  to  'not  day  trade'  but  hold  things  for  a  longer  period  and  don't  trade  a  large  number  of  different  stocks  every  week.  Seriously,  have  a  look  at  the  rules  and  see  what  it  implies..  an  average  of  20  buys  and  sells  of  longer  term  positions  PER  DAY  is  a  pretty  fair  bit  of  trading,  that's  really  churning  through  the  positions  compared  to  someone  who  might  establish  positions  with  say  25  well  picked  stocks  and  might  change  even  5  of  those  a  week  to  a  different  stock.    Or  even  a  larger  number  of  stocks  but  seeking  to  hold  them  for  over  a  year  so  you  get  taxed  at  the  long  term  cap  gains  rate.  If  you  want  to  day  trade,  be  prepared  to  be  labeled  as  such  and  deal  with  your  broker  on  that  basis.    Not  like  they  will  hate  you  given  all  the  fees  you  are  likely  to  rack  up.    And  the  government  will  love  you  also,  since  you'll  be  paying  short  term  gains  taxes.    (and  trust  me,  us  bogelheads  appreciate  the  liquidity  the  speculative  and  short  term  folks  bring  to  the  market.)  In  terms  of  how  it  would  impact  you,  Expect  to  be  required  to  have  a  fairly  substantial  balance  ($25K)  if  you  are  maintaining  a  margin  account.  I'd  suggest  reading  this  thread  My  account's  been  labeled  as  "day  trader"  and  I  got  a  big  margin  call.  What  should  I  do?  What  trades  can  I  place  in  the  blocked  period?
312515	You  should  check  directly  with  the  seller.  I  suspect  you  will  find  they  have  not  recieved  any  money.  Paypal  tend  to  hang  on  to  money  as  long  as  possible  in  all  transactions,  and  will  do  anything  to  avoid  giving  out  cash  before  it  has  come  in.
182684	PayPal  will  be  contacting  you  shortly,  I'm  sure.    You'll  see  the  reversal  on  their  site  in  a  few  days  as  well  as  a  fee  from  their  end  I  bet.
237397	I  made  this  mistake  and  tried  calling  Paypal...the  first  time  I  have  ever  been  unhappy  with  their  service.    The  girl  gave  me  some  number  but  didn't  make  it  clear  whether  it  was  an  order  reference  number  or  a  reference  phone  number  for  the  company  I  ordered  from.    I  called  within  10  minutes  of  placing  my  order  and  they  were  unable  to  cancel  or  change  the  payment  method.    I  did  find  however,  that  even  though  you  can't  pay  paypal  with  your  credit  card,  some  banks  will  let  you.    I  went  into  my  account  and  "paid"  my  account  the  amount  needed  using  my  credit  card  from  the  same  bank  that  I  had  intended  to  use  in  the  first  place...hopefully  it  went  through  quickly  enough  to  not  get  a  service  fee  from  Paypal
267609	You  setup  a  self-directed  solo  401k  by  paying  a  one  time  fee  for  a  company  to  setup  a  trust,  name  you  the  sole  trustee,  and  file  it  with  the  IRS.  None  of  these  companies  offer  TPA  because  it  opens  them  up  to  profit  leaching  liability.  After  you  have  your  trust  setup,  you  can  open  a  brokerage  account  or  several  with  any  of  the  big  names  you  want  (Vanguard,  Fidelity,  Ameritrade,  etc),  or  just  use  the  money  to  flip  houses,  do  P2P  lending,  whatever,  the  world  is  your  investment  oyster.  If  the  company  has  recurring  fees  you  need  to  ask  what  is  going  on  because  if  they  aren't  offering  TPA  services,  then  what  the  heck  could  they  be  charging  you  for?  I  did  see  one  company,  I  think  it  was  IRA  Financial  Group,  that  had  the  option  of  having  a  CPA  do  TPA  for  you  for  a  recurring  fee,  but  I  would  pass  on  that.  The  IRS  administration  requirements  are  typically  just  the  5500-EZ  that  you  have  to  file  as  a  hard  copy  by  July  31  if  your  investments  are  worth  more  than  $250k,  on  December  31.  Yes,  you  have  to  get  the  actual  form  from  the  IRS,  write  on  it  with  a  pen  and  mail  it  to  them  every  year,  barbaric.  You  can  either  have  your  accountant  do  it  or  do  it  yourself.  If  you're  below  $250k  just  google  solo  401k  rule  change  two  or  three  times  a  year  and  don't  try  to  launder  money.  If  anything,  the  rules  will  loosen  with  time,  I  don't  imagine  the  Republican  Congress  cracking  down  on  small  business  owners  any  time  soon.
593356	Fidelity  Investments  offers  Solo  401(k)  plans  without  any  management  fees.  The  plan  administrator  is  typically  the  employer  itself  (so,  your  business,  or  you  as  the  principal  manager).  You  (as  the  individual  employee)  are  the  participant.
114302	Massachusets  does  no  such  thing.  The  5.25%  tax  is  only  on  realized  gains.  "Unearned"  means  "doesn't  tie  to  your  trade/business",  i.e.:  is  not  gained  through  your  personal  performance.
385320	I  do  NOT  know  the  full  answer  but  I  know  here  are  some  important  factors  that  you  need  to  consider  :  Do  you  have  a  physical  location  in  the  United  States?  Are  you  working  directly  from  Canada?  With  a  office/business  location  in  the  United  States  your  tax  obligation  to  the  US  is  much  higher.  Most  likely  you  will  owe  some  to  the  state  in  which  your  business  is  located  in  Payroll  Tax  :  your  employer  will  likely  want  to  look  into  Payroll  tax,  because  in  most  states  the  payroll  tax  threshold  is  very  low,  they  will  need  to  file  payroll  tax  on  their  full-time,  part-time  employees,  as  well  as  contractor  soon  as  the  total  amount  in  a  fiscal  year  exceeds  the  threshold  Related  to  No.1  do  you  have  a  social  security  number  and  are  you  legally  entitled  to  working  in  the  States  as  an  individual.  You  will  be  receiving  the  appropriate  forms  and  tax  withholding  info  Related  to  No.3  if  you  don't  have  that  already,  you  may  want  to  look  into  how  to  obtain  permissions  to  conduct  business  within  the  United  States.  Technically,  you  are  a  one  person  consulting  service  provider.  You  may  need  to  register  with  a  particular  state  to  obtain  the  permit.  The  agency  will  also  be  able  to  provide  you  with  ample  tax  documentations.    Chances  are  you  will  really  need  to  piece  together  multiple  information  from  various  sources  to  resolve  this  one  as  the  situation  is  specific.  To  start,  look  into  consulting  service  /  contractor  work  permit  and  tax  info  for  the  state  your  client  is  located  in.  Work  from  state  level  up  to  kick  start  your  research  then  research  federal  level,  which  can  be  more  complex  as  it  is  technically  international  business  service  for  Canada-US
376859	You  are  smart  to  read  books  to  better  inform  yourself  of  the  investment  process.    I  recommend  reading  some  of  the  passive  investment  classics  before  focusing  on  active  investment  books:  If  you  still  feel  like  you  can  generate  after-tax  /  after-expenses  alpha  (returns  in  excess  of  the  market  returns),  take  a  shot  at  some  active  investing.    If  you  actively  invest,  I  recommend  the  Core  &  Satellite  approach:  invest  most  of  your  money  in  a  well  diversified  basket  of  stocks  via  index  funds  and  actively  manage  a  small  portion  of  your  account.    Carefully  track  the  expenses  and  returns  of  the  active  portion  of  your  account  and  see  if  you  are  one  of  the  lucky  few  that  can  generate  excess  returns.  To  truly  understand  a  text  like  The  Intelligent  Investor,  you  need  to  understand  finance  and  accounting.    For  example,  the  price  to  earnings  ratio  is  the  equity  value  of  an  enterprise  (total  shares  outstanding  times  price  per  share)  divided  by  the  earnings  of  the  business.    At  a  high  level,  earnings  are  just  revenue,  less  COGS,  less  operating  expenses,  less  taxes  and  interest.    Earnings  depend  on  a  company's  revenue  recognition,  inventory  accounting  methods  (FIFO,  LIFO),  purchase  price  allocations  from  acquisitions,  etc.    If  you  don't  have  a  business  degree  /  business  background,  I  don't  think  books  are  going  to  provide  you  with  the  requisite  knowledge  (unless  you  have  the  discipline  to  read  textbooks).    I  learned  these  concepts  by  completing  the  Chartered  Financial  Analyst  program.
261684	Those  extra  treat  points  have  to  come  from  somewhere,  and  they  come  from  American  Express  charging  merchants  a  higher  percentage  than  Visa  or  Mastercard.  So  it's  less  attractive  for  those  merchants  to  accept  it.
214139	American  Express  was  originally  a  mail  business  that  moved  into  money-orders.  Traditionally  their  cards  have  been  charge  cards  instead  of  a  credit  card  (though  they  have  credit  products  now  as  well).  They've  been  marketed  specifically  as  a  "premium"  product  for  people  who  have  a  significant  amount  of  money  (and  are  willing  to  pay  a  significant  fee  for  premium  services  such  as  AmEx's  good  airline  miles).  As  such,  Visa  and  MasterCard  are  more  widespread.  Additionally,  the  fees  that  Visa  and  MasterCard  charge  merchants  are  typically  lower  (Wikipedia  says  2%,  as  compared  to  AmEx's  2.5%,  at  least  in  the  US).  So:  American  Express  gets  less  business  as  a  company,  but  they  charge  higher  fees  to  make  up  for  it.  Merchants  will  only  accept  the  higher  fees  when  they  want  to  serve  people  who  have  a  lot  of  money  to  spend  (or  if  they  can  negotiate  a  discount).
370146	I  have  a  merchant  account  and  accept  Visa,  Mastercard,  and  Discover  but  not  AMEX.  I  don't  take  AMEX  because  they  want  me  to  go  through  another  approval  process  (on  top  of  what  was  required  to  get  merchant  status)  and  their  fees  are  a  percent  or  two  higher  than  the  other  cards.  This  doesn't  sound  like  a  lot  -  but  for  a  business  that  grosses  $1M  per  year,  an  extra  2  percentage  points  is  $20K.  I  don't  gross  $1M,  but  the  additional  cost  for  me  to  take  AMEX  would  still  use  the  word  "thousand"  and  I  don't  see  any  reason  to  jump  through  extra  hoops  and  fill  out  more  forms  for  the  privilege  of  giving  extra  money  away.  I  haven't  found  anyone  yet  who  wanted  to  pay  me  with  AMEX  who  can't  pay  me  with  another  card  or  a  check  instead.
308383	My  experience  is  in  the  United  States  only.  In  the  past,  American  Express  marketed  its  products  as  more  exclusive  and  prestigious  than  other  cards.    There  was  an  attempt  to  give  the  impression  that  cardholders  were  more  qualified  financially.    In  return,  fees  were  higher  both  to  merchants  and  to  cardholders.    At  the  time  (early  1990's),  it  was  not  common  to  use  credit  cards  for  small  purchases,  such  as  groceries  or  fast  food.    Credit  cards  were  used  for  larger  purchases  such  as  jewelry  or  electronics  or  dinner  in  a  nicer  restaurant.  Once  it  became  popular  to  use  credit  cards  for  everyday  purchases,  the  demand  for  customers  using  credit  cards  changed  to  the  highest  number  of  people  instead  of  people  of  higher  status.    At  that  point,  Visa  (and  to  a  lesser  extent  Mastercard)  transaction  volume  increased  dramatically.    Merchants  needed  the  largest  number  of  customers  with  cards,  not  the  most  financially  stable.    As  Visa  volume  grew,  and  people  started  using  Visa  for  small  purchases,  the  use  of  American  Express  decreased  as  their  habits  changed  (once  someone  got  used  to  pulling  out  Visa,  they  did  it  in  every  situation).    Merchants  are  less  willing  to  go  through  the  extra  hassle  of  accepting  cards  that  are  used  by  fewer  people.    Over  time,  I  suspect  this  process  led  to  the  gap  between  Visa  and  American  Express.  As  a  merchant,  in  order  to  accept  credit  cards,  you  have  to  set  up  a  bank  account  and  maintain  a  merchant  account.    Accepting  Visa,  MC  and  Discover  can  all  be  done  through  one  account,  but  American  Express  has  traditionally  required  a  separate  relationship,  as  well  as  its  own  set  of  rules  and  fees  that  were  generally  higher.    Since  there  are  relatively  few  American  Express  cardholders  compared  to  Visa,  there  is  doubt  about  whether  it  is  worth  it  accept  the  card.    It  depends  upon  the  customer  base.    Fine  restaurants  still  generally  accept  American  Express.
39006	For  some  people,  it's  easier  to  stick  to  a  budget  if  they  have  separate  checking  and  savings  accounts  because  they  can  deposit  funds  directly  into  their  savings  account  and  not  have  those  funds  accessible  by  debit/credit  card,  checks,  etc.  This  allows  people  to  pay  themselves  first  and  accumulate  savings,  while  making  it  slightly  more  difficult  to  spend  those  savings  on  a  whim.  One  a  more  technical/legal  note,  one  key  difference  in  the  United  States  comes  from  Regulation  D.  §204.2(d)(2)  of  the  law  limits  you  to  six  withdrawals  from  savings  and  money  market  accounts.  No  such  limit  exists  for  checking  accounts.  Regulation  D  also  forbids  banks  from  paying  interest  on  business  checking  accounts.    In  the  simplest  case,  checking  accounts  and  savings  accounts  are  a  tradeoff  between  liquidity  and  return.  Checking  accounts  are  much  more  liquid,  but  won't  necessarily  earn  interest,  while  savings  accounts  are  less  liquid  because  of  the  withdrawal  limits,  but  earn  interest.  Nowadays,  however,  sweep  accounts  blur  this  line  somewhat  because  they  function  like  checking  accounts,  in  that  you  can  write  an  unlimited  number  of  checks,  make  an  unlimited  number  of  withdrawals,  etc.  but  you  can  also  earn  interest  on  your  account  balance  because  some  or  all  of  the  funds  are  "swept"  into  an  investment  account  when  not  in  use.  The  definition  of  "in  use"  can  vary  from  business  to  business  and  bank  to  bank.
274369	A  checking  account  is  instant  access.  It  can  be  tapped  via  check  or  debit  card.    A  savings  account  is  supposed  to  be  used  to  accumulate  cash  for  a  goal  that  is  is  longer  term  or  for  an  emergency.    Many  people  need  to  separate  these  funds  into  different  accounts  to  be  able  to  know  if  they  are  overspending  or  falling  short  on  their  savings.  In  the  United  States  the  Federal  Reserve  also  looks  at  these  accounts  differently.  Money  in  a  checking  account  generally  can't  be  used  to  fund  loans,  money  in  a  savings  account  can  be  used  as  a  source  of  loans  by  the  bank.  An  even  greater  percentage  of  funds  in  longer  term  accounts  can  be  used  to  fund  loans.  This  includes  Certificates  of  Deposit,  and  retirement  accounts.
558611	If  your  debit  card/ATM  card  is  stolen  or  lost,  someone  else  might  be  able  to  withdraw  money  from  the  checking  account  that  it  is  tied  to,  or  buy  things  with  the  card  and  have  the  money  taken  out  of  the  checking  account  to  pay  the  merchant.  Subject  to  daily  withdrawal  limits  imposed  by  your  bank,  a  considerable  amount  of  money  could  be  lost  in  this  way.  At  least  in  the  US,    debit  or  ATM  cards,  although  they  are  often  branded  Mastercard  or  Visa,  do  not  provide  the  same  level  of  protection  as  credit  cards  for  which  the  liability  is  limited  to  $50  until  the  card  is  reported  as  lost  or  stolen  and  $0  thereafter.    Note  also  that  the  money  in  your  savings  account  is  safe,  unless  you  have  chosen  an  automatic  overdraft  protection  feature  that  automatically  transfers  money  from  your  savings  account  into  the  checking  account  to  cover  overdrafts.  So  that  is  another  reason  to  keep  most  of  your  money  in  the  savings  account  and  only  enough  for  immediately  foreseeable  needs  in  the  checking  account  (and  to  think  carefully  before  accepting  automatic  overdraft  protection  offers).  These  days,  with  mobile  banking  available  via  smartphones  and  the  like,  transferring  money  yourself  from  savings  to  checking  account  as  needed  might  be  a  preferred  way  of  doing  things  on  the  go  (until  the  smartphone  is  stolen!)
228308	Additionally,  it  used  to  be  the  case  that  savings  accounts  would  have  a  noticeably  higher  interest  than  checking  accounts  (if  the  checking  account  paid  any  at  all).    So  you  would  attempt  to  maximize  your  cash  working  for  you  by  putting  as  much  as  you  could  into  the  savings  account  and  then  only  transferring  out  what  you  needed  to  cover  bills,  etc  into  the  checking  account.
530119	I'm  no  tax  expert  by  any  means.  I  do  know  that  a  disreagarded  entity  is  considered  a  sole  proprietor  for  federal  tax  purposes.  My  understanding  is  that  this  means  your  personal  tax  year  and  your  business  tax  year  must  be  one  and  the  same.  Nevertheless,  it  is  technically  possible  to  have  a  non-calendar  fiscal  year  as  an  individual.  This  is  so  rare  that  I'm  unable  to  find  a  an  IRS  reference  to  this.  The  best  reference  I  could  find  was  this  article  written  by  two  CPAs.  If  you  really  want  to  persue  this,  you  basically  need  to  talk  with  an  accountant,  since  this  is  complicated,  and  required  keeping  propper  accounting  records  for  your  personal  life,  in  addition  to  your  business.  A  ledger  creqated  after-the-fact  by  an  accountant  has  been  ruled  insufficent.  You  really  need  to  live  by  the  fiscal  year  you  choose.
153375	I  know  some  companies  or  entities  have  large  incomes  or  expenses  at  certain  times  of  the  year,  and  like  to  close  their  books  after  these  large  events.    For  example  where  I  work,    the  primary  seasonal  income  comes  after  summer,  so  our  fiscal  year  ends  at  the  last  days  of  October.    This  gives  the  accountants  enough  time  to  collect  all  the  funds,  reconcile  whatever  they  have  to,  pay  off  whatever  they  have  to  and  get  working  on  a  budget  for  the  next  year  sooner  than  a  calendar  year  would.  There  also  might  be  tax  reasons.    To  get  all  of  your  income  at  the  beginning  of  your  fiscal  year,  even  if  that  is  in  the  middle  of  the  calendar  year  would  allow  a  company  to  plan  large  deductible  investments  with  more  certainty.    I  am  not  to  sure  of  the  tax  reasons.
382133	I  can  think  of  a  few  good  reasons:  A  company,  especially  public,  usually  wants  their  fourth-quarter  earnings  to  be  the  strongest  of  the  year.  That  ends  each  fiscal  year  on  a  high  note  for  the  company  and  its  investors,  which  helps  public  sentiment  and  boosts  stock  prices.  So,  travel  agencies  and  airlines  usually  like  ending  their  year  in  October  or  March,  in  the  lull  between  the  summer  and  winter  travel  seasons  with  a  large  amount  of  that  revenue  falling  within  the  company's  fiscal  Q4.  Oil  companies  sometimes  do  the  same  because  fuel  prices  are  seasonal  for  much  the  same  reasons.  December  is  a  really  bad  month  to  try  to  close  out  an  entire  year's  accounting  books.  Accountants  and  execs  are  on  vacation  for  large  parts  of  the  month,  most  retail  stores  are  flooded  with  revenue  (and  then  contra-revenue  as  items  are  returned)  that  takes  time  to  account  at  the  store  level  and  then  filter  up  to  the  corporate  office,  etc  etc.  It  also  doesn't  tell  the  whole  story  for  most  retail  outfits;  December  sales  are  usually  inflated  by  purchases  that  are  then  returned  in  January  after  all  the  hullaballoo.  As  a  result,  a  fiscal  year  end  in  January  or  even  February  keeps  the  entire  season's  revenues  and  expenses  in  one  fiscal  year.
108709	My  grandfather  owned  a  small  business,  and  I  asked  him  that  very  question.    His  answer  was  that  year-end  closeout  is  very  time-consuming,  both  before  and  after    EOY  (end  of  year),  and  that  they  didn't  want  to  do  all  that  around  Christmas  and  New  Year.
103175	Maybe  it's  just  because  of  the  foundation  date.  If  I  start  a  company  on  August  1st,  I  would  like  its  FY  starts  on  that  date  too,  in  order  to  track  my  first  whole  year.  Would  be  quite  useless  to  finish  my  year  on  December,  after  just  five  months.  I  want  to  have  data  of  my  first  year  after  a  twelve  months  activity.
181266	In  addition  to  the  company-specific  annual  business  cycle  reasons  and  company-specific  historical  reasons  mentioned  in  the  other  answers,  there  is  another  reason.  Accounting  firms  tend  to  be  very  busy  during  January  (and  February  and  March)  when  most  companies  are  closing  and  auditing  their  calendar-year  books.    If  a  company  chooses  its  fiscal  year  to  end  at  a  different  time  of  year,  the  accounting  firms  are  more  available,  and  the  auditing  costs  might  be  lower.
69012	There  are  2  different  things,  As  per  IT  Act,  one  can  get  "Medical  Reimbursement"  upto  Rs  15,000  which  is  tax  free.  The  way  it  is  supposed  to  work  is  an  employee  submits  bill  and  employer  will  "Reimburse"  upto  Rs  15,000.  So  if  one  does  not  submit  any  bills,  he  does  not  get  any  money.  If  the  employer  has  given  the  employee  Rs  15,000  without  any  bills,  it  would  have  been  taxed  as  per  the  tax  bracket.  In  practise  all  employer  factor  the  Rs  15,000  in  the  salary  to  the  employee.  If  bills  are  submitted,  then  its  tax  free.  If  bill  are  not  submitted,  partially  submitted,  the  difference  is  paid  as  "Allowance"  and  hence  becomes  taxable.  Apart  from  above  there  is  section  80D  that  provides  additional  rebate.  Upto  Rs  15,000  when  health  insurance  is  taken.  Upto  Rs  5,000  for  Health  checkup.  Hence  if  you  submit  the  details  to  your  employer  you  will  get  rebate  in  tax,  on  Rs  5,000  it  would  be  Rs  1,500/-.  You  would  not  get  "Reimbursement".  I  should  mention  20,000  under  medical  expenses  Nope  both  are  under  different  section  as  such  you  should  declare  these  separately.
138746	Deduction  for  Health  Checkup  is  allowed  under  Section  80D  and  is  allowed  to  everyone  whether  Salaried  or  Business/Professional.  However,  Exemption  for  Medical  Reimbursement  of  Rs.  15000  is  allowed  under  a  different  section.    A  salaried  employee  can  take  benefit  of  both  Medical  Reimbursement  of  Rs.  15,000  as  well  as  Preventive  Health  Check-up  of  Rs.  5,000.

47230	Never  buy  a  house  unless  you  really  want  to  buy  that  house.  If  you  want  to  buy  a  rental,  look  around  and  find  the  right  rental  to  buy;  saving  a  few  hundred  on  moving  costs  isn't  a  good  reason  to  buy  the  wrong  property  at  the  wrong  price.
342382	Can  he  legally  break  your  lease  if  he  sells  the  place?    If  not  I  would  just  keep  renting.  It  doesn't  sound  like  you  love  the  house  and  you  plan  on  moving  or  would  prefer  a  different  type  of  place  long  term.  Unless  you  yourself  plan  on  getting  involved  in  being  a  renting  it  out  to  others  in  the  future  -  just  rent  and  move  on  at  some  point.  If  he  can  break  your  lease  upon  sale  of  the  property  then  I'd  be  casually  keeping  an  eye  out  for  another  place  to  rent  if  that  happens.
159403	There  are  probably  thousands  of  houses  that  you  could  buy.  If  you  want  to  buy  a  house,  it  is  very  unlikely  that  the  one  you  are  renting  right  now  is  the  best  possible  buy.    Usually  people  living  in  the  houses  they  own  are  more  interested  in  the  quality  of  their  property  and  the  quality  of  their  neigborhood  than  people  who  are  renting,  so  I'd  say  that  you  are  generally  better  off  finding  a  home  to  buy  in  an  area  where  the  majority  own  their  homes.
191550	You  can  report  the  violation  to  the  payment  network  (i.e.,  Mastercard  or  Visa).    For  instance  here  is  a  report  form  for  Visa  and  here  is  one  for  MasterCard.    I  just  found  those  by  googling;  there  are  no  doubt  other  ways  of  contacting  the  companies.  Needless  to  say,  you  shouldn't  expect  that  this  will  result  in  an  immediate  hammer  of  justice  being  brought  down  on  the  merchant.    Given  the  presence  of  large-scale  fraud  schemes,  it's  unlikely  Visa  is  going  to  come  after  every  little  corner  store  owner  who  charges  a  naughty  50-cent  surcharge.    It  is  also  unlikely  that  threatening  to  do  this  will  scare  the  merchant  enough  to  get  them  to  drop  the  fee  on  your  individual  transaction.    (Many  times  the  cashier  will  be  someone  who  has  no  idea  how  the  process  actually  works,  and  won't  even  understand  the  threat.)    However,  this  is  the  real  solution  in  that  it  allows  the  payment  networks  to  track  these  violations,  and  (at  least  in  theory)  they  could  come  after  the  merchant  if  they  notice  a  lot  of  violations.
174774	Mastercard  rules  also  prohibit  asking  for  ID  along  with  the  card.  Yet,  when  I  was  at  Disneyland,  years  ago  (so  I  don't  know  if  this  is  still  a  practice)  they  asked  for  my  driver's  license  with  every  purchase.  I  can  charge  up  to  $200  at  Costco  with  a  swipe,  not  even  a  signature,  but  a  $5  bottle  of  water  (maybe  it  was  $6)  required  me  to  produce  my  license.    The  answer  is  Pete's  comment,  don't  patronize  these  merchants.  By  the  way,  it's  legal  now.  From  Visa  web  site  -    Note  -  9*  states  still  prohibit  surcharges,  so  they  tend  to  offer  cash  discounts.  The  question  you  linked  is  from  2010,  things  change.
495751	This  might  not  be  the  answer  you  are  looking  for,  but  the  alternative  to  "don't  patronize  these  merchants"  is  this:  DO  patronize  these  merchants,  and  pay  cash.      Credit  cards  are  convenient.    (I  use  a  credit  card  often.)    However,  there  is  no  denying  that  they  cost  the  merchants  an  incredible  amount  in  fees,  and  that  our  entire  economy  is  paying  for  these  fees.    The  price  of  everything  is  more  than  it  needs  to  be  because  of  these  fees.    Yes,  you  get  some  money  back  with  your  rewards  card,  but  the  money  you  get  back  comes  directly  from  the  store  you  made  the  purchase  with,  and  the  reward  is  paid  for  by  increasing  the  price  of  everything  you  buy.    In  addition,  those  among  us  that  do  not  have  the  credit  score  necessary  to  obtain  a  rewards  card  are  paying  the  same  higher  price  for  goods  as  the  rest  of  us,  but  don't  get  the  cash  back  reward.  Honestly,  it  seems  quite  fair  to  me  that  only  the  people  charging  purchases  to  a  credit  card  should  have  to  pay  the  extra  fee  that  goes  along  with  that  payment  processing.    If  a  store  chooses  to  do  that,  I  pay  cash  instead,  and  I  am  grateful  for  the  discount.
41859	You  have  no  recourse  on  the  spot  to  do  anything  to  the  vendor  other  than  pay  the  fee,  pay  cash,  or  walk  away.    If  you're  on  a  mission  with  longer-term  horizon  than  immediate  satisfaction,  your  options  will  vary  by  state.    If  you're  in  a  state  where  the  fees  are  legal  and  the  owner  is  (potentially)  violating  an  agreement  with  the  card  company,  you  can  report  the  vendor  to  the  card  company.    They  may  or  may  not  really  care.    If  you're  in  a  state  where  the  fee  is  actually  illegal,  you'd  need  to  see  what  options  you  have  with  the  local  authorities.  You  should  keep  in  mind  that  if  the  vendor  is  violating  an  agreement  that's  between  the  vendor  and  the  card  company  only,  you  have  absolutely  no  rights  to  enforce  that  agreement.    You  only  have  legal  rights  if  you're  a  party  to  the  agreement  in  question  or  if  the  law  gives  you  some  special  rights  specific  to  given  circumstances.  (The  lawyers  call  this  having  "standing.")    Likewise  if  the  vendor  is  doing  something  that's  not  consistent  with  the  agreement  between  you  and  the  card  company,  you  also  have  no  claim  against  the  vendor  (because  the  vendor  is  not  party  to  your  agreement  with  the  card  company),  although  you  might  have  a  claim  against  the  card  company.
448225	It  may  seem  very  simple  on  its  face  but  you  don't  know  the  merchant's  agreement.    You  don't  know  who  is  providing  the  processing  equipment.    You  don't  know  a  lot  of  things.    You  know  that  Visa,  Mastercard,  Discover,  Amex  and  others  have  network  requirements  and  agreements.    You  know  that  laws  have  been  changed  to  allow  merchant  surcharges  (previously  it  was  contracts  that  prohibited  surcharges,  not  laws).      That  gas  station,  or  that  pizza  parlor,  or  any  other  merchant  doesn't  have  a  direct  relationship  with  Visa  or  Mastercard;  it  has  an  agreement  with  a  bank  or  other  processing  entity.    The  issue  here,  is  whom  do  you  even  call?    And  what  would  you  gain?    Find  out  what  bank  is  contracted  for  that  particular  equipment  and  file  a  complaint  that  the  merchant  charged  you  $0.35?    Maybe  the  merchant  agreement  allows  surcharges  up  to  state  and  local  maximums?    You  don't  know  the  terms  of  their  agreement.    Calling  around  to  figure  out  what  parties  are  involved  to  understand  the  terms  of  their  agreement  is  a  waste  of  time,  like  you  said  you  can  just  go  across  the  street  if  it's  so  offensive  to  you.    Or  just  carry  a  little  cash.      If  that's  not  the  answer  you're  looking  for,  here's  one  for  you:  There  is  no  practical  recourse.
177573	I  gather  that,  while  it  is  not  illegal  for  a  merchant  to  pass  their  payment  card  processing  fees  on  to  their  customers  directly  in  the  form  of  a  surcharge,  doing  so  is  a  violation  of  their  merchant  agreements  with  the  payment  card  processor  (at  least  for  Visa/MC).  It's  not  -  surcharging  has  been  permissible  since  2013,  as  a  result  of  a  class  action  lawsuit  against  Visa  and  MC.  It's  still  prohibited  by  state  law  in  9  states.    If  you're  in  one  of  those  9  states,  you  can  contact  your  state  Attorney  General  to  report  it.  If  you're  not,  you  can  check  to  see  if  the  business  is  complying  with  the  rules  set  forth  by  the  card  brands  (which  include  signage  at  the  point  of  sale,  a  separate  line  item  for  the  surcharge  on  the  receipt,  a  surcharge  that  doesn't  exceed  4%  of  the  transaction,  etc.)  and  if  they're  in  violation,  contact  the  card  company.  However,  some  of  those  rules  seem  to  matter  to  the  card  companies  more  than  others,  and  it's  entirely  possible  they  won't  do  anything.  In  which  case,  there's  nothing  you  can  really  do.
151023	An  LLC  is  a  very  flexible  company  when  it  comes  to  taxation.    You  have  three  basic  tax  options:  There  are  other  good  reasons  to  create  an  LLC  (mainly  to  protect  your  personal  assets)  so  even  if  you  decide  that  you  don't  want  to  deal  with  the  complications  of  an  S-Corp  LLC,  you  should  still  consider  creating  a  sole  proprietorship  LLC.
596645	Frequency  of  paychecks  is  up  to  the  company.  Many  pay  monthly.  Some  pay  twice  a  month,  or  every  other  week.  I  haven't  heard  of  any  paying  more  frequently  unless  they  were  tiny  "mom  and  pop"  businesses  or  grunt-labor/fast-food  minimum-wage  jobs.  Cutting  the  checks  more  often  is  more  expensive  for  the  company.  And  frequency  of  pay  is    one  of  the  things  you  agreed  to  in  the  paperwork  you  signed  when  you  were  hired.
46145	The  SFGate  had  an  article  on  this  a  few  years  ago:  http://www.sfgate.com/business/networth/article/When-government-fines-companies-who-gets-cash-3189724.php  "Civil  penalties,  often  referred  to  as  fines,  usually  go  to  the  U.S.  Treasury  or  victims."  Short  answer  in  the  case  you  references  it  would  be  the  US  Treasury.  In  cases  where  there  is  a  harmed  party  then  they  would  get  something  to  account  for  their  loss.  But  it  can  get  complicated  depending  on  the  crime.
200054	When  you  sell  the  stock  your  income  is  from  the  difference  of  prices  between  when  you  bought  the  stock  and  when  you  sold  it.  There's  no  interest  there.  The  interest  is  in  two  places:  the  underlying  company  assets  (which  you  own,  whether  you  want  it  or  not),  and  in  the  distribution  of  the  income  to  the  owners  (the  dividends).  You  can  calculate  which  portion  of  the  interest  income  constitutes  your  dividend  by  allocating  the  portions  of  your  dividend  in  the  proportions  of  the  company  income.  That  would  (very  roughly  and  unreliably,  of  course)  give  you  an  estimate  what  portion  of  your  dividend  income  derives  from  the  interest.  Underlying  assets  include  all  the  profits  of  the  company  that  haven't  been  distributed  through  dividends,  but  rather  reinvested  back  into  the  business.  These  may  or  may  not  be  reflected  in  the  market  price  of  the  company.  Bottom  line  is  that  there's  no  direct  correlation  between  the  income  from  the  sale  of  the  stake  of  ownership  and  the  company  income  from  interest,  if  any  correlation  at  all  exists.  Why  would  you  care  about  interest  income  of  Salesforce?  Its  not  a  bank  or  a  lender,  they  may  have  some  interest  income,  but  that's  definitely  not  the  main  income  source  of  the  company.  If  you  want  to  know  how  much  interest  income  exactly  the  company  had,  you'll  have  to  dig  deep  inside  the  quarterly  and  annual  reports,  and  even  then  I'm  not  sure  if  you'll  find  it  as  a  separate  item  for  a  company  that's  not  in  the  lending  business.
112003	Their  interest  expense  was  $17M.  Where  you  see  $5.14/sh  in  Key  Statistics,  any  daily  interest  received  is  more  than  canceled  out  by  the  expense  paid  at  the  same  time.  I  understand  your  concern,  but  this  company  is  not  "sitting  on  cash"  as  are  Apple,  Google,  etc.  Short  term  rates  are  well  below  1%,  1yr  tbill  looks  like  about  .2%.  So  strictly  speaking,  each  share  might  have  1  cent  interest  you  need  to  concern  yourself  with.  Disclaimer  to  other  readers  -  This  has  nothing  to  do  with  taxes.  OP  is  asking  about  a  specific  part  of  the  company  cash  flow.  His  worst  case  is  $1  per  100  shares.
80538	If  you  forgot  to  put  the  name  on  the  "pay  to  the  order  of"  line  then  anybody  who  gets  their  hands  on  the  check  can  add  their  name  to  the  check  and  deposit  it  at  their  bank  into  their  account.  If  it  goes  to  the  correct  person  they  will  have  an  easy  time  making  sure  that  the  check  is  made  out  correctly.  They  don't  have  to  worry  about  that  picky  teller  who  doesn't  know  what  to  do  with  a  check  made  out  to  Billy  Smith  and  a  drivers  license  for  Xavier  William  Smith.  On  the  other  hand...  a  criminal  will  also  be  able  to  make  sure  it  is  processed  exactly  the  way  they  want  it.  If  I  made  it  out  to  a  small  business  or  a  person  I  would  let  them  know.  You  might  not  have  a  choice  but  to  wait  and  see  what  happens  if  it  was  sent  to  a  large  business,  the  payment  processing  center  could  be  a  long  way  from  where  you  will  be  calling.
228403	​​​​​You're  not  missing  anything.  Excess  cash  is  somewhat  of  a  nebulous  concept.  To  different  people  it  means  different  things.  The  answer  is  that  excess  cash  varies  for  each  company  depending  on  their  business.  For  instance,  some  companies  need  very  high  amounts  of  working  capital.  A  company  may  be  increasing  their  inventories  and  therefore  will  require  more  cash  on  their  balance  sheet  to  fund  growth.  If  a  company  always  needs  this  extra  cash,  some  investors  prefer  to  leave  that  cash  out  of  a  valuation  because  the  company  cannot  run  profitably  without  it.  Think  about  what  happens  to  your  calculation  of  Enterprise  Value  if  you  subtract  excess  cash  as  opposed  to  cash.  Excess  cash  is  always  less  than  cash.  Therefore  by  subtracting  excess  cash  you  increase  EV.  Since  one  common  valuation  metric  is  EV/EBITDA,  a  higher  numerator  will  make  the  stock  seem  more  expensive  -  that  is  the  EV/EBITDA  ratio  will  seem  higher  when  using  excess  cash  as  opposed  to  cash.  So  using  excess  cash  in  your  valuation  methodology  is  basically  a  conservative  concept.  Depending  on  the  business  20%  of  revenues  seem  way  too  high  as  a  reserve  for  excess  cash.  2%  is  a  much  better  rule  of  thumb.
2304	20%  is  almost  certainly  too  high.  I  agree  with  2%,  as  a  very  rough  rule.  It  will  vary  significantly  depending  on  the  industry.  I  generally  calculate  an  average  of  the  previous  2-3  years  working  capital,  and  deduct  that  from  cash.  Working  capital  is  Current  Assets  less  Current  Liabilities.  Current  Assets  is  comprised  of  cash,  prepaid  expenses,  and  significantly,  accounts  receivable.  This  means  that  CA  is  likely  to  be  much  higher  than  just  cash,  which  leaves  more  excess  cash  after  liabilities  are  deducted.  Which  reduces  EV,  which  makes  the  EV/EBITDA  ratio  look  even  more  pricey,  as  Dimitri  noted.  But  a  balance  sheet  is  just  a  snapshot  of  the  final  day  of  the  quarter.  As  such,  and  because  of  seasonal  effects,  it's  critical  to  smooth  this  by  averaging  several  periods.  After  calculating  this  for  a  few  companies,  compare  to  revenue.  Is  it  close  to  2%?
150650	Excess  Cash  =  Cash  &  Equivalents  +  Long-Term  Investments  -  Current  Liabilities  The  problem  this  calculation  of  excess  cash  is  that  "long-term  investments"  can  be  illiquid  things  like  real  estate.  Another  flaw  is  that  it  gives  no  credit  for  Current  Assets,  like  receivables,  which  can  be  used  to  offset  Current  Liabilities.  The  first  thing  I'd  do  is  "net  out"  Current  Assets  and  Current  Liabilities,  then  add  Cash  back  in.    Excess  Cash  =  Current  Assets  -  Current  Liabilities  +  Cash  &  Equivalents.  It  would  be  nice  if  GAAP  would  require  Long-Term  Investments  to  be  broken  out  as  a)  liquid  long-term  investments  (stocks,  bonds)  b)  illiquid  long-term  investments  (real  estate,  private  equity,  etc)
239446	Yep,  there  just  is  no  free  lunch.    So  called  high  dividend  stocks  are  usually  from  companies  that  have  stable  cash  flows  but  relatively  little  or  moderate  growth  potential.  Utility  companies  come  to  mind,  let's  take  telecommunications  as  an  example.    Such  stocks,  usually,  indeed  are  considered  more  conservative.  In  a  bull  market,  they  won't  make  high  jumps,  and  in  a  bear  market  they  shouldn't  experience  deep  falls.  I  mean,  just  because  the  stock  market  fell  by  10%,  you're  not  going  to  stop  using  your  phone.  The  stock  might  suffer  a  bit  but  the  divided  is  still  yielding  you  the  same.  However,  fundamental  data  can  have  a  significant  impact.  Let's  say  a  recession  hits  the  country  of  the  telco.  People  might  not  get  the  newest  iPhone  and  lock  in  to  an  expensive  contract  anymore,  they  might  use  cheaper  forms  of  communication,  they  might  stop  paying  bills,  go  bankrupt  etc.  This  will  have  a  severe  impact  on  the  company's  cash  flow  and  thus  hit  the  stock  in  a  double  whammy:  One,  the  dividend  is  gone.  Two,  the  price  will  fall  even  further.    There  are  basically  two  scenarios  after  that.  Either  the  recession  is  temporary  and  your  stock  became  a  regular  growth  stock  that  at  some  point  might  bounce  back  and  re-establish  at  the  previous  levels.  Or  the  economy  has  contracted  permanently  but  regained  stability  in  which  case  you  will  again  have  a  stock  with  a  high  dividend  yield  but  based  on  a  lower  price.  In  conclusion:  High  dividend  stocks  make  sense  in  a  portfolio.  But  never  consider  their  income  to  be  safe.  Reduce  your  risk  by  diversifying.
271153	Dividend  Stocks  like  any  stock  carry  risk  and  go  both  up  and  down.    It  is  important  to  choose  a  stock  based  on  the  company's  potential  and  performance.    And,  if  they  pay  a  dividend  it  does  help.  -RobF
404336	The  risk  in  a  divident  paying  stock  can  come  from  2  sources.  The  business  of  the  company,  or  the  valuation  of  the  stock  at  the  time  you  buy.    The  business  of  the  company  relates  to  how  they  are  running  things,  the  risks  they  are  taking  with  the  company,  innovations  in  their  pipeline,  and  their  competitive  landscape.  You  can  find  all  sorts  of  examples  of  companies  that  paid  nice  dividends  but  didn't  end  so  well...  Eastman  Kodak,  Enron,  Lehman  brothers,  all  used  to  pay  very  nice  dividends  at  some  point...    On  the  other  hand  you  have  the  valuation.  The  company  is  running  great,  but  the  market  has  unrealistic  expectations  about  it.  Think  Amazon  and  Yahoo  back  in  2001...  the  price  was  way  too  high  for  the  company's  worth.  As  the  price  of  a  stock  goes  up,  the  return  that  you  get  from  its  future  cash  flows  (dividends)  goes  down  (and  viceversa).    If  you  want  to  go  deep  into  the  subject,  check  out  this  course  from  Chicago  U  they  spend  a  lot  of  time  talking  about  dividends,  future  returns  from  stocks  and  the  risk  rewards  of  finding  stocks  by  methods  such  as  these.
561140	Having  a  good  dividend  yield  doesn't  guarantee  that  a  stock  is  safe.  In  the  future,  the  company  may  run  into  financial  trouble,  stop  paying  dividends,  or  even  go  bankrupt.  For  this  reason,  you  should  never  buy  a  stock  just  because  it  has  a  high  dividend  yield.  You  also  need  some  criteria  to  determine  whether  that  stock  is  safe  to  buy.  Personally,  I  consider  a  stock  is  reasonably  safe  if  it  meets  the  following  criteria:
506575	No  stock  is  risk-free.  Some  of  the  biggest  companies  in  the  country,  that  seemed  incredibly  stable  and  secure,  have  suffered  severe  downturns  or  gone  out  of  business.  Twenty  or  thirty  years  ago  Kodak  ruled  the  camera  film  market.  But  they  didn't  react  quickly  enough  when  digital  cameras  came  along  and  today  they're  a  shadow  of  their  former  self.  Forty  years  ago  IBM  owned  like  90%  of  the  computer  market  --  many  people  used  "IBM"  as  another  word  for  computer.  Sears  used  to  dominate  the  retail  department  store  market.  Etc.
584531	One  strategy  to  consider  is  a  well-diversified  index  fund  of  equities.  These  have  historically  averaged  7-8%  real  growth.  So  withdrawing  3%  or  4%  yearly  under  that  growth  should  allow  you  to  withdraw  30+  years  with  little  risk  of  drawing  down  all  your  capital.  As  a  bonus  you're  savings  target  would  come  down  from  $10  million  to  $2.5  million  to  a  little  under  $3.5  million.
513775	Should  you  negotiate?  Yes,  what  harm  can  it  possibly  do?  The  landlord  is  unlikely  to  come  back  and  say  "Because  you  tried  to  negotiate,  I'm  putting  the  rent  up  by  10%  instead.",  or  to  evict  a  paying  tenant  merely  because  they  tried  to  negotiate.  Is  the  proposed  rent  increase  "normal"?  Yes.  Landlords  will  generally  try  to  get  as  high  a  rent  as  they  can.
397749	There  could  be  a  number  of  reasons  for  a  rent  increase.  The  only  information  I  can  offer  is  how  I  calculate  what  rent  I  will  charge.  The  minimum  I  would  ever  charge  per  unit  (Mortgage  payment  +  Water)  /  Number  of  units  This  number  is  the  minimum  because  it's  what  I  need  to  keep  afloat.    Keep  in  mind  these  are  ballpark  numbers  The  target  rent  ((Mortgage  payment  +  Water)  /  Number  of  units)*1.60  I  mark  up  the  price  60%  for  a  few  reasons.  First,  the  building  needs  a  repair  budget.  That  money  has  to  come  from  somewhere.  Second,  I  want  to  put  away  for  my  next  acquisition  and  third  I  want  to  make  a  profit.  These  get  me  close  to  my  rental  price  but  ultimately  it  depends  on  your  location  and  the  comparables  in  the  area.  If  my  target  rent  is  600  a  month  but  the  neighbors  are  getting  700-800  for  the  same  exact  unit  I  might  ask  more.  It  also  depends  on  the  types  of  units.  Some  of  my  buildings,  all  of  the  units  are  identical.  Other  buildings  half  of  the  units  are  bigger  than  the  other  half  so  clearly  I  wouldn't  charge  a  equal  amount  for  them.  Ultimately  you  have  to  remember  we're  not  in  the  game  to  lose  money.  I  know  what  my  renters  are  going  to  pay  before  I  even  put  an  offer  in  on  a  building  because  that's  how  I  stay  in  business.  It  might  go  up  over  the  years  but  it  will  always  outpace  my  expenses  for  that  property.
29761	There  has  been  almost  no  inflation  during  2014-2015.  do  you  mean  rental  price  inflation  or  overall  inflation?  Housing  price  and  by  extension  rental  price  inflation  is  usually  much  higher  than  the  "basket  of  goods"  CPI  or  RPI  numbers.  The  low  levels  of  these  two  indicators  are  mostly  caused  by  technology,  oil  and  food  price  deflation  (at  least  in  the  US,  UK,  and  Europe)  outweighing  other  inflation.  My  slightly  biased  (I've  just  moved  to  a  new  rental  property)  and  entirely  London-centric  empirical  evidence  suggests  that  5%  is  quite  a  low  figure  for  house  price  inflation  and  therefore  also  rental  inflation.  Your  landlord  will  also  try  to  get  as  much  for  the  property  as  he  can  so  look  around  for  similar  properties  and  work  out  what  a  market  rate  might  be  (within  tolerances  of  course)  and  negotiate  based  on  that.  For  the  new  asked  price  I  could  get  a  similar  apartment  in  similar  condos  with  gym  and  pool  (this  one  doesn't  have  anything)  or  in  a  way  better  area  (closer  to  supermarkets,  restaurants,  etc).  suggests  that  you  have  already  started  on  this  and  that  the  landlord  is  trying  to  artificially  inflate  rents.  If  you  can  afford  the  extra  5%  and  these  similar  but  better  appointed  places  are  at  that  price  why  not  move?  It  sounds  like  the  reason  that  you  are  looking  to  stay  on  in  this  apartment  is  either  familiarity  or  loyalty  to  the  landlord  so  it  may  be  time  to  benefit  from  a  move.
237784	Yes,  automatic  rate  increases  are  typical  in  my  experience  (and  I  think  it's  very  greedy,  when  it's  based  on  nothing  except  that  your  lease  is  up  for  renewal,  which  is  the  situation  you  are  describing).  Yes,  you  should  negotiate.  I've  had  success  going  to  the  apartment  manager  and  having  this  conversation:    Make  these  points:  Conclude:  I  am  not  open  to  a  rate  increase,  though  I  will  sign  a  renewal  at  the  same  rate  I  am  paying  now.  This  conversation  makes  me  very  uncomfortable,  but  I  try  not  to  show  it.  I  was  able  to  negotiate  a  lease  renewal  at  the  same  rate  this  way  (in  a  large  complex  in  Sacramento,  CA).    If  you  are  talking  to  a  manager  and  not  an  owner,  they  will  probably  have  to  delay  responding  until  they  can  check  with  the  owner.  The  key  really  is  that  they  want  to  keep  units  rented,  especially  when  units  are  staying  empty.  Empty  units  are  lost  income  for  the  owner.  It  is  the  other  empty  units  that  are  staying  empty  that  are  the  huge  point  in  your  favor.
584890	What  happened  in  the  past,  the  rent  you  paid  last  year,  is  in  the  past.    You  shouldn't  be  concerned  with  the  percentage  increase,  but  with  whether  you  want  that  apartment  at  the  new  rent  for  the  coming  year.    If  your  rent  had  been  half  what  it  was  last  year  and  the  new  proposal  were  to  double  it,  you  would  be  outraged  at  the  doubling,  but  really  you  got  a  steal  last  year.      Going  forward,  you  have  three  options.    You  can  accept  the  new  rent,  you  can  decline  it  and  move,  or  you  can  try  to  negotiate  a  better  rate.    It  sounds  like  the  landlord  is  hoping  you  will  find  the  hassle  of  moving  enough  to  accept  the  new  rent.    If  you  do  negotiate,  you  should  know  what  your  preferred  alternative  is,  which  you  should  use  to  set  your  walkaway  point.    If  you  make  a  counterproposal,  it  is  often  useful  to  show  what  a  comparable  apartment  is  renting  for  to  justify  the  rent  you  suggest.
478221	If  it  is  true  that  for  the  same  price,  you  could  get  a  better  place  (or  that  for  a  lower  price  you  could  get  an  equivalent  place),  you  should  do  some  soul-searching  to  decide  what  monetary  value  you  would  place  on  the  hassle  of  moving  to  such  an  alternative.    You  should  then  negotiate  aggressively  for  a  rent  that  is  no  more  than  the  rent  of  the  alternative  place  plus  your  hassle  costs,  and  if  the  landlord  does  not  meet  your  price,  you  should  refuse  to  renew  your  lease,  and  instead  move  out  to  an  alternative.    (Of  course,  you  might  also  want  to  double-check  your  research  to  ensure  you  really  can  get  such  a  good  alternative,  and  that  your  new  landlords  won't  try  a  similar  bait-and-switch  and  force  you  to  move  again  in  a  year.)  Barring  local  ordinances  such  as  rent  control  laws,  I  don't  think  it's  worth  it  to  worry  about  whether  the  increase  is  "normal".    If  you  can  get  a  better  deal  somewhere  else,  then  what  your  landlords  are  asking  is  too  much.    If  you  have  a  good  relationship  with  them  on  a  personal  level  you  may  be  able  to  tell  them  this  in  a  nice  way  and  thus  get  them  to  make  a  more  reasonable  offer.    Otherwise,  the  landlords  will  learn  that  their  expectations  are  unreasonable  when  all  their  tenants  move  out  to  cheaper  places.
121382	I  think  people  are  missing  the  most  obvious  thing.    The  yearly  rate  increases  are  just  part  of  the  landlord  schtick  and  it  is  good  business  for  them.    My  grandmother  owned  several  large  apartment  complexes.    She  would  raise  rates  for  any  resident  that  had  been  there  between  1-5  years  by  5-7%  a  year.    Even  when  she  had  vacancies  and  property  values  didn't  go  up.    For  the  following  reasons:  So  yes  it  is  not  only  normal  but  just  part  of  the  business.    If  there  are  better  apartments  for  less  money  I  suggest  you  move  there.    Soon  those  other  apartments  will  even  out  and  if  they  are  better  they  will  be  much  more.    So  if  you  see  a  gap  take  advantage  of  it.    If  you  would  rather  stay,  then  simply  say  you  will  not  pay  the  increase.    There  is  no  use  arguing  about  why.    The  landlord  will  either  be  OK  with  it  or  say  no.    Probably  the  biggest  factors  include  whether  you  will  tell  other  tenants  (or  their  perception  if  you  would)  and  how  good  of  a  tenant/risk  they  feel  you  are.
183781	Absolutely  yes.  Just  because  a  lease  provides  an  option  for  renewal  does  not  mean  that  a  tenant  cannot  try  to  re-negotiate  for  better  terms.  You  should  always  negotiate  the  rent.  And  start  this  conversation  as  soon  as  possible.  Offer  to  pay  three  months’  rent  in  advance  (of  course,  if  you  have  enough  means).
456470	What  is  a  dividend?  Essentially,  for  every  share  of  a  dividend  stock  that  you  own,  you  are  paid  a  portion  of  the  company’s  earnings.  You  get  paid  simply  for  owning  the  stock!  For  example,  let’s  say  Company  X  pays  an  annualized  dividend  of  20  cents  per  share.  Most  companies  pay  dividends  quarterly  (four  times  a  year),  meaning  at  the  end  of  every  business  quarter,  the  company  will  send  a  check  for  1/4  of  20  cents  (or  5  cents)  for  each  share  you  own.  This  may  not  seem  like  a  lot,  but  when  you  have  built  your  portfolio  up  to  thousands  of  shares,  and  use  those  dividends  to  buy  more  stock  in  the  company,  you  can  make  a  lot  of  money  over  the  years.  The  key  is  to  reinvest  those  dividends!  Source:  http://www.dividend.com/dividend-investing-101/what-are-dividend-stocks/  What  is  an  ex  dividend  date  Once  the  company  sets  the  record  date,  the  ex-dividend  date  is  set  based  on  stock  exchange  rules.  The  ex-dividend  date  is  usually  set  for  stocks  two  business  days  before  the  record  date.  If  you  purchase  a  stock  on  its  ex-dividend  date  or  after,  you  will  not  receive  the  next  dividend  payment.  Instead,  the  seller  gets  the  dividend.  If  you  purchase  before  the  ex-dividend  date,  you  get  the  dividend.  Source:  https://www.sec.gov/answers/dividen.htm  That  said,  as  long  as  you  purchased  the  stock  before  6/4/17  you  are  entitled  to  the  next  dividend.  If  not,  you'll  get  the  following  one  after  that.
1198	Yes,  as  long  as  you  own  the  shares  before  the  ex-dividend  date  you  will  get  the  dividends.  Depending  on  your  instructions  to  your  broker,  you  can  receive  cash  dividends  or  you  can  have  the  dividends  reinvested  in  more  shares  of  the  company.  There  are  specific  Dividend  ReInvestment  Plans  (or  DRIPs)  if  you  are  after  stock  growth  rather  than  income  from  dividend  payments.
564271	gnasher729,  was  able  to  see  my  problem  here.  It  was  a  silly  oversight.  It's  not  50p  a  share,  its  0.5p  a  share.  @Bezzzo:  The  dividend  is  not  50p  per  share,  it  is  0.50p  per  share  -      half  a  penny  per  share.  Thanks!
293404	This  is  what  this  sounds  like  to  me:  https://www.thebalance.com/having-a-garage-sale-or-yard-sale-what-to-do-first-399030  also:  http://blogs.hrblock.com/2012/07/25/garage-sale-money-does-the-irs-need-to-know/  Selling  a  personal  item  at  a  loss  is  generally  not  a  taxable  event.  You  cannot  report  it  as  a  loss,  and  the  IRS  can't  tax  a  transaction  like  that.  If  you  really  want  to  include  these  as  sales  as  part  of  your  LLC,  you'll  probably  have  to  pay  tax  if  you  list  it  as  income.  I'm  just  confused  as  to  why  you'd  want  to  do  that,  if  you  know  that  you're  selling  these  particular  items  at  a  loss,  and  you  also  know  that  you  have  no  documentation  for  them.  I  just  wouldn't  report  anything  you  sold  at  a  loss  and  treat  it  as  "garage  sale  items"  separate  from  your  business.
299211	-Alain  Wertheimer  I'm  a  hobbyist...  Most  (probably  all)  of  those  older  items  were  sold  both  prior  to  my  establishing  the  LLC  This  is  a  hobby  of  yours,  this  is  not  your  business.  You  purchased  all  of  these  goods  for  your  pleasure,  not  for  their  future  profit.  The  later  items  that  you  bought  after  your  LLC  was  establish  served  both  purposes  (perks  of  doing  what  you  love).    How  should  I  go  about  reporting  this  income  for  the  items  I  don't  have  records  for  how  much  I  purchased  them  for?    There's  nothing  you  can  do.  As  noted  above,  these  items  (if  you  were  to  testify  in  court  against  the  IRS).  "Losses  from  the  sale  of  personal-use  property,  such  as  your  home  or  car,  aren't  tax  deductible."  Source  Do  I  need  to  indicate  100%  of  the  income  because  I  can't  prove  that  I  sold  it  at  a  loss?  Yes,  if  you  do  not  have  previous  records  you  must  claim  a  100%  capital  gain.  Source  Addition:  As  JoeTaxpayer  has  mentioned  in  the  comments,  the  second  source  I  posted  is  for  stocks  and  bonds.    So  at  year  begin  of  2016,  I  started  selling  what  I  didn't  need  on  eBay  and  on  various  forums  [January  -  September].  Because  you  are  not  in  the  business  of  doing  this,  you  do  not  need  to  explain  the  cost;  but  you  do  need  to  report  the  income  as  Gross  Income  on  your  1040.  Yes,  if  you  bought  a  TV  three  years  ago  for  a  $100  and  sold  it  for  $50,  the  IRS  would  recognize  you  earning  $50.    As  these  are  all  personal  items,  they  can  not  be  deducted;  regardless  of  gain  or  loss.  Source  Later  in  the  year  2016  (October),  I  started  an  LLC  (October  -  December)  If  these  are  items  that  you  did  not  record  early  in  the  process  of  your  LLC,  then  it  is  reported  as  a  100%  gain  as  you  can  not  prove  any  business  expenses  or  costs  to  acquire  associated  with  it.    Source  Refer  to  above  answer.    Refer  to  above  answer.    Conclusion  Again,  this  is  a  income  tax  question  that  is  split  between  business  and  personal  use  items.  This  is  not  a  question  of  other's  assessment  of  the  value  of  the  asset.  It  is  solely  based  on  the  instruments  of  the  IRS  and  their  assessment  of  gains  and  losses  from  businesses.  As  OP  does  not  have  the  necessary  documents  to  prove  otherwise,  a  cost  basis  of  $0  must  be  assumed;  thus  you  have  a  100%  gain  on  sale.
51323	I  believe  it's  just  to  limit  the  less  well-off  from  acquiring  one.  If  your  credit  history  and  income  do  not  support  a  $15,000  credit  limit,  then  don't  even  think  about  applying  for  an  Altitude  Black  card.  If  they  do,  then  don't  bother  with  a  student  card.  It's  primarily  about  market  segmentation  by  wealth  or  income.
338406	They  have  a  minimum  to  discourage  applications  for  that  particular  card.  Every  application  costs  them  money  because  they  have  to  pay  the  credit  agencies  to  pull  the  applicant's  credit  history.  So  one  way  they  save  money  and  reduce  their  cost  of  business  is  to  discourage  people  from  applying  if  they're  not  creditworthy  enough  for  that  product.  Credit  card  companies  tailor  their  products  into  different  income/credit  brackets.  Those  who  have  less  creditworthiness  would  be  better  suited  for  a  different  product  than  what  you're  referring,  similar  to  those  with  greater  creditworthiness.
112516	It  discourages  people  from  obtaining  a  high-limit  card  simply  to  show  off,  because  the  bank's  forcing  them  to  use  it  or  lose  it.
581098	Many  real  estate  agents  will  assist  with  an  apartment  hunt,  for  a  suitable  fee.  In  a  hot  market  that  may  be  worth  the  money.  Then  again,  my  best  finds  were  always  through  co-workers,  after  the  first  two.
544254	Actually  sounds  like  an  interesting  concept  for  a  business,  potentially!  (grin)  You  know,  depending  on  where  you  live  and  how  big  the  market  is,  you  might  see  if  there's  a  local  "concierge"  service.    These  are  companies  that  will  act  like  personal  shoppers/assistants  for  you  in  all  kinds  of  ways.    I  can't  speak  to  the  quality  of  their  services  or  the  pricing  they  use,  but  it  would  be  a  great  place  to  start.  I'm  sure  you  can  find  listings  of  them  on  the  web.
85914	Shop  around  for  Gym  January  is  a  great  time  to  look  because  that's  when  most  people  join  and  the  gyms  are  competing  for  your  business.    Also,  look  beyond  the  monthly  dues.    Many  gyms  will  give  free  personal  training  sessions  when  you  sign  up  -  a  necessity  if  you  are  serious  about  getting  in  shape!  My  gym  offered  a  one  time  fee  for  3  years.    It  cost  around  $600  which  comes  out  to  under  $17  a  month.  Not  bad  for  a  new  modern  state  of  the  art  gym.
298745	If  you're  determined  to  save  money,  find  ways  to  integrate  exercise  into  your  daily  routine  and  don't  join  a  gym  at  all.  This  makes  it  more  likely  you'll  keep  it  up  if  it  is  a  natural  part  of  your  day.  You  could  set  aside  half  the  money  you  would  spend  on  the  gym  towards  some  of  the  options  below.  I  know  it's  not  always  practical,  especially  in  the  winter,  but  here  are  a  few  things  you  could  do.    One  of  the  other  answers  makes  a  good  point.  Gym  membership  can  be  cost  effective  if  you  go  regularly,  but  don't  kid  yourself  that  you'll  suddenly  go  5  times  a  week  every  week  if  you've  not  done  much  regular  exercise.    If  you  are  determined  to  join  a  gym,  here  are  a  few  other  things  to  consider.
272872	Try  a  gym  for  a  month  before  you  sign  up  on  any  contracts.    This  will  also  give  you  time  to  figure  out  if  you  are  the  type  who  can  stick  with  a  schedule  to  workout  on  regular  basis.    Community  centres  are  cost  effective  and  offer  pretty  good  facilities.    They  have  monthly  plans  as  well  so  no  long  term  committments.
11722	Find  a  physical  activity  or  programme  that  interests  you.    Memberships  only  have  real  value  if  you  use  them.    Consider  learning  a  martial  art  like  karate,  aikido,  kung  fu,  tai  kwan  do,  judo,  tai  chi  chuan.  :-)      Even  yoga  is  a  good  form  of  exercise.  Many  of  these  are  offered  at  local  community  centres  if  you  just  want  to  try  it  out  without  worrying  about  the  cost  initially.    Use  this  to  gauge  your  interest  before  considering  more  advanced  clubs.    One  advantage  later  on  if  you  stay  with  it  long  enough  -  some  places  will  compensate  you  for  being  a  junior  or  even  associate  instructor.  Regardless  of  whether  this  is  your  interest  or  if  the  gym  membership  is  more  to  your  liking  real  value  is  achieved  if  you  have  a  good  routine  and  interest  in  your  physical  fitness  activity.    It  also  helps  to  have  a  workout  buddy  or  partner.    They  will  help  motivate  you  to  try  even  when  you  don't  feel  like  working  out.
593134	The  gym  I  used  to  use  was  around  £35-40  a  month,  its  quite  a  big  whack  but  if  you  think  about  it;  its  pretty  good  value  for  money.  That  includes  gym  use,  swimming  pool  use,  and  most  classes  Paying  for  a  gym  session  is  around  £6  a  go,  so  if  you  do  that  3  times  a  week,  then  make  use  of  the  other  facilities  like  swimming  at  the  weekends,  maybe  a  few  classes  on  the  nights  your  not  at  the  gym  it  does  work  out  ok  As  for  deals,  my  one  used  to  do  family  membership  deals,  and  I  think  things  like  referring  a  friend  gives  you  money  off  etc.  They  will  probably  also  put  on  some  deals  in  January  since  lots  of  people  want  to  give  it  a  go  being  new  year  and  all
403563	Look  for  discounts  from  a  health  insurance  provider,  price  club,  professional  memberships  or  credit  cards.  That  goes  for  a  lot  of  things  besides  health  memberships.    My  wife  is  in  a  professional  woman's  association  for  networking  at  work.    A  side  benefit  is  an  affiliate  network  they  offer  for  discounts  of  lots  of  things,  including  gym  memberships.
342113	I  came  across  an  article  posted  at  Squawkfox  last  week.    It's  particularly  relevant  to  answering  this  question.    See  10  Ways  to  Cut  Your  Fitness  Membership  Costs.    Here's  an  excerpt:  [...]      If  you’re  in  the  market  for  a      shiny  new  gym  membership,  it  may  be      wise  to  read  the  fine  print  and  know      your  rights  before  agreeing  to  a      fitness  club  contract.  No  one  wants  to      be  stuck  paying  for  a  membership  they      can  no  longer  use,  for  whatever      reason.      But  if  you’re  revved  and  ready  to  burn      a  few  calories,  here  are  ten  ways  to      get  fitter  while  saving  some  cash  on  a      fitness  club  or  gym  membership.  Yay,      fitness  tips!        [...]  Check  it  out!
483480	Say  you're  buying  a  400K  house.  Your  relative  finances  120K  (30%).  Say  I'm  optimistic,  but  the  real-estate  market  recovers,  and  your  house  is  worth  600K  in  5-6  years  (can  happen,  with  the  inflation  and  all).  The  gain  is  200K.  Your  relative  gets  100K.  You  repay  him  220K  on  120K  loan  for  5  years.  Roughly,  16%  APR.  Quite  an  expensive  loan.  I'm  of  course  optimistic,  it  seems  to  me  that  so  is  your  relative.  The  question  is:  if  the  house  loses  value  in  that  term,  does  your  relative  take  50%  of  the  losses?  Make  calculations  based  on  several  expected  returns  (optimistic,  "realistic",  loss  case,  etc),  and  for  each  calculate  how  much  in  fact  will  that  loan  cost.  It  will  help  you  to  decide  if  you  want  it.  Otherwise  your  relationships  with  your  relative  might  go  very  bad  in  a  few  years.  BTW:  Suggestion:  it's  a  bad  idea  to  mix  business  and  friend/family  you  don't  want  to  lose.
236540	I  would  recommend  against  loans  from  family  members.  But  if  you  decide  to  go  down  that  path  take  care  of  the  basics:  This  is  a  business  decision  so  treat  it  like  one.  I  would  add  that  the  situation  you  describe  sounds  extremely  generous  to  your  family  member.  I'd  look  at  standard  loan  agreements  (ie.  in  the  marketplace)  and  model  your  situation  more  on  them  -  if  you  do  this,  even  with  you  paying  a  premium,  you'd  never  come  up  with  something  as  generous  as  what  you  have  described.
510232	Keep  in  mind  that  lenders  will  consider  the  terms  of  any  loans  you  have  when  determining  your  ability  to  pay  back  the  mortgage.  They'll  want  to  see  paperwork,  or  if  you  claim  it  is  a  gift  they  will  require  a  letter  to  that  effect  from  your  relative.  Obviously,  this  could  effect  your  ability  to  qualify  for  a  loan.
537831	In  effect,  you  are  paying  for  70%  of  the  house  but  he  gets  half  the  gain.  On  the  flip  side,  you're  living  there,  so  that  probably  makes  up  this  difference.    It  will  be  toughest  if  the  house  jumps  in  value,  to  the  point  you  might  be  forced  to  sell.    You  might  want  to  think  about  that  a  bit.
591163	Lenders  pay  attention  to  where  your  down  payment  money  comes  from.  If  they  see  a  large  transfer  of  money  into  your  bank  account  within  about  a  year  before  your  purchase,  this  WILL  cause  an  issue  for  you.  Down  payments  are  not  just  there  to  make  the  principal  smaller;  they  are  primarily  used  as  an  underwriting  data-point  to  assess  your  quality  as  a  borrower.  If  you  take  the  money  as  loan,  it  will  count  against  your  credit  worthiness.  If  you  take  the  money  as  a  gift,  it  will  raise  some  other  red  flags.  All  of  this  is  done  for  a  reason:  if  you  can't  get  a  down  payment,  you  are  a  higher  credit  risk  (poor  discipline,  lack  of  consistent  income),  even  if  you  can  (currently)  pay  the  monthly  cost  of  a  mortgage.    (PS  -  The  cost  of  home  ownership  is  much  higher  than  the  monthly  mortgage  payment.)  Will  all  this  mean  you  WON'T  get  a  loan?  Of  course  not.  You  can  almost  always  get  SOME  loan.  But  it  will  likely  be  at  a  higher  rate  than  you  otherwise  would  qualify  for  if  you  just  waited  a  little  bit  and  saved  money  for  a  down  payment.    (Another  option:  cheaper  house.)  EDIT:  The  below  comments  provide  examples  where  gifts  were/are  NOT  a  problem.  My  experience  from  buying  a  house  just  a  few  years  ago  (and  my  several  friends  who  bought  house  in  the  same  period,  some  with  family  gifts  and  some  without)  is  that  it  IS  an  issue.  Your  best  bet  is  to  TALK,  IN  PERSON  with  an  actual  mortgage  broker  in  your  area  who  can  go  through  the  options  with  you,  and  the  downsides  to  various  approaches.
305920	I'll  compare  it  to  a  situation  that  is  different,  but  will  involve  the  same  cash  flow.    Imagine  the  buyer  agrees  that  you  buy  only  70%  of  the  house  right  now,  and  the  remaining  30%  in  7  years  time.    It  would  be  obviously  fair  to  pay  70%  of  today's  value  today,  pay  30%  of  a  reasonable  rent  for  7  years  (because  30%  of  the  house  isn't  owned  by  you),  then  pay  30%  of  the  value  that  the  house  has  in  7  years  time.  30%  of  the  value  in  7  years  is  the  same  as  30%  of  the  value  today,  plus  30%  of  whatever  the  house  gained  in  value.    Instead  you  pay  70%  of  today's  value,  you  pay  no  rent  for  the  30%  that  you  don't  own,  then  in  7  years  time  you  pay  30%  of  today's  value,  plus  50%  of  whatever  the  house  gained  in  value.  So  you  are  basically  exchanging  30%  of  seven  years  rent,  plus  interest,  for  20%  of  the  gain  in  value  over  7  years.  Which  might  be  zero.  Or  might  be  very  little.  Or  a  lot,  in  which  case  you  are  still  better  off.      Obviously  you  need  to  set  up  a  bullet  proof  contract.  A  lawyer  will  also  tell  you  what  to  put  into  the  contract  in  case  the  house  burns  down  and  can't  be  rebuilt,  or  you  add  an  extension  to  the  home  which  increases  the  value.    And  keep  in  mind  that  this  is  a  good  deal  if  the  house  doesn't  increase  in  value,  but  if  the  house  increases  in  value  a  lot,  you  benefit  anyway.  A  paradoxical  situation,  where  the  worse  the  deal  turns  out  to  be  after  7  years,  the  better  the  result  for  you.  In  addition,  the  relative  carries  the  risk  of  non-payment,  which  the  bank  obviously  is  not  willing  to  do.
404852	Source  Rule  41  of  the  AIM  Rules  sets  out  the  procedure  for  delisting.  In  summary,  a  company  that  wishes  to  cancel  the  right  of  any  of  its  trading  securities  must:  The  notification  to  the  Exchange  should  be  made  by  the  company’s  nominated  adviser    and  should  be  given  at  least  20  business  days  prior  to  the  intended  cancellation  date  (the  20  business  days’  notice  requirement  is  a  minimum).  Any  cancellation  of  a  company’s  securities  on  AIM  will  be  conditional  upon  seeking  shareholder  approval  in  general  meeting  of  not  less  than  75%  of  votes  cast  by  its  shareholders  present  and  voting  (in  person  or  by  proxy)  at  the  meeting.  The  notification  to  shareholders  should  set  out  the  preferred  date  of  cancellation,  the  reasons  for  seeking  the  cancellation  (for  example  annual  fees  to  the  Exchange,  the  cost  of  maintaining  a  nominated  adviser  and  broker,  professional  costs,  corporate  governance  compliance,    inability  to  access  funds  on  the  market),  a  description  of  how  shareholders  will  be  able  to  effect  transactions  in  the  AIM  securities  once  they  have  been  cancelled  and  any  other  matters  relevant  to  shareholders  reaching  an  informed  decision  upon  the  issue  of  the  cancellation.  Cancellation  will  not  take  effect  until  at  least  5  business  days  after  the  shareholder  approval  is  obtained  and  a  dealing  notice  has  been  issued  by  the  Exchange.  It  should  be  noted  that  there  are  circumstances  where  the  Exchange  may  agree  that  shareholder  consent  is  not  required  for  the  cancellation  of  admission  of  a  company’s  shares,  for  example  (i)  where  comparable  dealing  facilities  on  an  EU  regulated  market  or  AIM  designated  market  are  put  in  place  to  enable  shareholders  to  trade  their  AIM  securities  in  the  future  or  (ii)  where,  pursuant  to  a  takeover  which  has  become  wholly  unconditional,  an  offeror  has  received  valid  acceptances  in  excess  of  75%  of  each  class  of  AIM  securities.    The  company’s  Nominated  Adviser  will  liaise  with  the  Exchange  to  secure  a  dispensation  if  relevant.  So  you  should  receive  information  from  the  company  regarding  the  due  process  informing  you  about  your  options.
402332	You  would  still  be  the  legal  owner  of  the  shares,  so  you  would  almost  certainly  need  to  transfer  them  to  a  broker  than  supports  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange  (which  allows  you  to  trade  on  the  Shanghai  exchange).  In  order  to  delist  they  would  need  to  go  through  a  process  which  would  include  enabling  shareholders  to  continue  to  access  their  holdings.
123971	You're  in  the  same  situation  I'm  in  (bought  new  house,  didn't  sell  old  house,  now  renting  out  old  house).  Assuming  that  everything  is  stable,  right  now  I'd  do  something  besides  pay  down  your  new  mortgage.  If  you  pay  down  the  mortgage  at  your  old  house,  that  mortgage  payment  will  go  away  faster  than  if  you  paid  down  the  one  on  the  new  house.    Then,  things  start  to  get  fun.    You  then  have  a  lot  more  free  cash  flow  available  to  do  whatever  you  like.  I'd  tend  to  do  that  before  searching  for  other  investments.    Then,  once  you  have  the  free  cash  flow,  you  can  look  for  other  investments  (probably  a  wise  risk)  or  retire  the  mortgage  on  your  residence  earlier.
247449	I'll  assume  you  live  in  the  US  for  the  start  of  my  answer  -  Do  you  maximize  your  retirement  savings  at  work,  at  least  getting  your  employer's  match  in  full,  if  they  do  this.  Do  you  have  any  other  debt  that's  at  a  higher  rate?    Is  your  emergency  account  funded  to  your  satisfaction?  If  you  lost  your  job  and  tenant  on  the  same  day,  how  long  before  you  were  in  trouble?    The  "pay  early"  question  seems  to  hit  an  emotional  nerve  with  most  people.  While  I  start  with  the  above  and  then  segue  to  "would  you  be  happy  with  a  long  term  5%  return?"  there's  one  major  point  not  to  miss  -  money  paid  to  either  mortgage  isn't  liquid.  The  idea  of  owing  out  no  money  at  all  is  great,  but  paying  anything  less  than  "paid  in  full"  leaves  you  still  owing  that  monthly  payment.  You  can  send  $400K  against  your  $500K  mortgage,  and  still  owe  $3K  per  month  until  paid.  And  if  you  lose  your  job,  you  may  not  so  easily  refinance  the  remaining  $100K  to  a  lower  payment  so  easily.    If  your  goal  is  to  continue  with  real  estate,  you  don't  prepay,  you  save  cash  for  the  next  deal.  Don't  know  if  that  was  your  intent  at  some  point.    Disclosure  -  my  situation  -  Maxing  out  retirement  accounts  was  my  priority,  then  saving  for  college.  Over  the  years,  I  had  multiple  refinances,  each  of  which  was  a  no-cost  deal.  The  first  refi  saved  with  a  lower  rate.  The  second,  was  in  early  2000s  when  back  interest  was  so  low  I  took  a  chunk  of  cash,  paid  principal  down  and  went  to  a  20yr  from  the  original  30.  The  kid  starts  college,  and  we  target  retirement  in  6  years.  I  am  paying  the  mortgage  (now  2  years  into  a  10yr)  to  be  done  the  month  before  the  kid  flies  out.  If  I  were  younger,  I'd  be  at  the  start  of  a  new  30  yr  at  the  recent  4.5%  bottom.  I  think  that  a  cost  of  near  3%  after  tax,  and  inflation  soon  to  near/exceed  3%  makes  borrowing  free,  and  I  can  invest  conservatively  in  stocks  that  will  have  a  dividend  yield  above  this.  Jane  and  I  discussed  the  plan,  and  agree  to  retire  mortgage  free.
212320	A  lot  depends  on  whether  your  mortgage  payments  are  interest  only  or  'repayment'  and  what  the  remaining  term  is  on  each  of  the  mortgages.    Either  way  I  suspect  that  the  best  value  for  the  money  you  put  in  will  be  had  by  making  payments  to  the  larger,  newer  mortgage.    This  is  because  the  quicker  you  reduce  the  capital  owed  the  less  interest  you  will  pay  over  the  whole  term  of  the  mortgage  and  you've  already  had  the  older  mortgage  for  sometime  (unless  you  remortgaged)  so  the  benefit  you  can  get  from  an  arbitrary  reduction  in  the  capital  is  inevitably  less  than  you  will  get  from  the  same  reduction  in  the  capital  of  the  newer  mortgage.    Even  if  the  two  mortgages  are  the  same  age  then  the  benefit  of  putting  money  into  the  one  on  the  new  house  is  greater  due  to  the  greater  interest  charged  on  it.
174987	Pay  down  the  lower  balance  on  the  rental  property.  Generally  speaking,  you  are  more  likely  to  need/want  to  sell  the  rental  house  as  business  conditions  change  or  if  you  need  the  money  for  some  other  purpose.  If  you  pay  down  your  primary  residence  first,  you  are  building  equity,  but  that  equity  isn't  as  liquid  as  equity  in  the  rental.  Also,  in  the  US,  you  cannot  deduct  the  interest  on  a  rental  property,  so  the  net  interest  after  taxes  that  you're  paying  on  the  rental  narrows  the  gap  between  the  4.35%  loan  and  the  5%  loan.
491923	One  advantage  of  paying  down  your  primary  residence  is  that  you  can  refinance  it  later  for  10-15  years  when  the  balance  is  low.  Refinancing  a  rental  is  much  harder  and  interest  rates  are  often  higher  for  investors.  This  also  assumes  that  you  can  refinance  for  a  lower  rate  in  the  nearest  future.  The  question  is  really  which  would  you  rather  sell  if  you  suddenly  need  the  money?  I  have  rental  properties  and  i'd  rather  move  myself,  than  sell  the  investments  (because  they  are  income  generating  unlike  my  own  home).  So  in  your  case  i'd  pay  off  primary  residence  especially  since  the  interest  is  already  higher  on  it  (would  be  a  harder  decision  if  it  was  lower)
296528	Yes  it  is  legal,  in  fact  according  to  statistics.gov.uk,  foreign  investors  are  the  largest  holders  of  UK  shares  (as  of  2008).  Investors  from  outside  the  UK  owned  41.5  per  cent  of  shares  listed  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange  at  the  end  of  2008,  up  from  40.0  per  cent  at  end  of  2006,  according  to  the  latest  Office  for  National  Statistics  report  on  share  ownership.
209493	It's  easy  to  own  many  of  the  larger  UK  stocks.  Companies  like  British  Petroleum,  Glaxo,  and  Royal  Dutch  Shell,  list  what  they  call  ADRs  (American  Depositary  Receipts)  on  the  U.S.  stock  exchanges.  That  is,  they  will  deposit  local  shares  with  Bank  of  NY  Mellon,  JP  Morgan  Chase,  or  Citicorp  (the  three  banks  that  do  this  type  of  business),  and  the  banks  will  turn  around  and  issue  ADRs  equivalent  to  the  number  of  shares  on  deposit.  This  is  not  true  with  "small  cap"  companies.  In  those  cases,  a  broker  like  Schwab  may  occasionally  help  you,  usually  not.  But  you  might  have  difficulty  trading  U.S.  small  cap  companies  as  well.
589625	Yes,  However  if  you  live  in  the  USA  a  lot  of  companies  will  refuse  to  sent  you  any  report  and  will  not  let  you  take  part  in  “right  issues”  as  they  don’t  wish  to  come  under  USA  investment  law.
349567	for  buying:  High  PE,  low  debt,  discount  =  win.  a  company  with  high  debt  (in  relation  to  revenues  and  cash  on  hand)  will  have  to  pay  interest  and  pay  off  the  debt,  stunting  their  growth.  and  just  like  a  normal  person,  will  barely  be  able  to  pay  their  bills  and  keep  borrowing  and  might  go  bankrupt  determining  discount  is  just  looking  for  a  technical  retracement  to  a  support  level  or  lower.  (but  if  you  dont  enter  at  the  support  level,  you  most  likely  missed  the  best  entry)
62417	I  look  at  the  following  ratios  and  how  these  ratios  developed  over  time,  for  instance  how  did  valuation  come  down  in  a  recession,  what  was  the  trough  multiple  during  the  Lehman  crisis  in  2008,  how  did  a  recession  or  good  economy  affect  profitability  of  the  company.  Valuation  metrics:  Enterprise  value  /  EBIT  (EBIT  =  operating  income)  Enterprise  value  /  sales  (for  fast  growing  companies  as  their  operating  profit  is  expected  to  be  realized  later  in  time)  and  P/E  Profitability:  Operating  margin,  which  is  EBIT  /  sales  Cashflow  /  sales  Business  model  stability  and  news  flow
216098	Mainly  because  they  can.    Yes,  there  is  a  cost  for  banks  to  execute  such  transactions,  and  yes,  there  is  a  cost  to  cover  the  implied  risks,  but  it  is  far  from  3  or  4%.  There  are  banks  that  charge  a  flat  rate  of  less  than  30$  (and  no  percentage),  so  for  larger  amounts,  it  is  worth  shopping  around.  Note  that  for  smaller  amounts,  which  are  the  majority  of  personal  transactions,  that  is  probably  about  as,  if  not  more  expensive,  than  paying  3%  -  below  1000$,  3%  is  less  than  30$.  So  charging  a  percentage  is  actually  better  for  people  that  want  to  transfer  smaller  amounts.
339581	All  institutions,  financial  or  otherwise,  seek  to  maximize  profits.  In  a  free  market,  each  bank  would  price  its  services  to  be  competitive  with  the  current  state  of  the  market.  Since  the  currency  conversion  fee  is  generally  a  small  part  of  the  decision  as  to  which  bank  to  choose,  banks  can  be  non-competitive  in  this  area.  If  this  is  an  important  consideration  for  you  then  you  would  need  to  find  a  bank  with  a  lower  conversion  fee,  but  be  prepared  to  have  higher  fees  in  other  areas.  TL;DR:  The  market  bears  it.
386745	Why  do  these  fees  exist?  From  a  Banks  point  of  view,  they  are  operating  in  Currency  A;  Currency  B  is  a  commodity  [similar  to  Oil,  Grains,  Goods,  etc].  So  they  will  only  buy  if  they  can  sell  it  at  a  margin.    Currency  Conversion  have  inherent  risks,  on  small  amount,  the  Bank  generally  does  not  hedge  these  risks  as  it  is  expensive;  but  balances  the  position  end  of  day  or  if  the  exposure  becomes  large.  The  rate  they  may  get  then  may  be  different  and  the  margin  covers  it.  Hence  on  highly  traded  currency  pairs;  the  spread  is  less.    Are  there  back-end  processes  and  requirements  that  require  financial  institutions  to  pass  off  the  loss  to  consumers  as  a  fee?  The  processes  are  to  ensure  bank  does  not  make  loss.  is  it  just  to  make  money  on  the  convenience  of  international  transactions?  Banks  do  make  money  on  such  transactions;  however  they  also  take  some  risks.  The  Forex  market  is  not  single  market,  but  is  a  collective  hybrid  market  place.  There  are  costs  a  bank  incurs  to  carry  and  square  off  positions  and  some  of  it  is  reflected  in  fees.    If  you  see  some  of  the  remittance  corridors,  banks  have  optimized  a  remittance  service;  say  USD  to  INR,  there  is  a  huge  flow  often  in  small  amounts.  The  remittance  service  aggregates  such  amounts  to  make  it  a  large  amount  to  get  a  better  deal  for  themselves  and  passes  on  the  benefits  to  individuals.  Such  volume  of  scale  is  not  available  for  other  pairs  /  corridors.
470032	In  my  experience  working  at  a  currency  exchange  money  service  business  in  the  US:  Flat  fees  are  the  "because  we  can"  fee  on  average.  These  can  be  waived  on  certain  dollar  values  at  some  banks  or  MSBs,  and  sometimes  can  even  be  haggled.    If  you  Google  EURUSD,  as  an  example,  you  also  get  something  like  $1.19  at  4pm,  9/18/2017.  If  you  look  at  the  actual  conversion  that  you  got,  you  may  find  your  bank  hit  you  with  $1.30  or  something  close  to  convert  from  USD  to  Euro  (in  other  words,  you  payed  10%  more  USD  per  Euro).  And,  if  you  sell  your  Euro  directly  back,  you  might  find  you  only  make  $1.07.  This  spread  is  the  real  "fee"  and  covers  a  number  of  things  including  risk  or  liquidity.  You'll  see  that  currencies  with  more  volatility  or  less  liquidity  have  a  much  wider  spread.  Some  businesses  even  go  as  far  as  to  artificially  widen  the  spread  for  speculators  (see  IQD,  VND,  INR,  etc.).  Typically  if  you  see  a  3%  surcharge  on  international  ATM  or  POS  transactions,  that's  the  carrier  such  as  Visa  or  Mastercard  taking  their  cut  for  processing.  Interestingly  enough,  you  also  typically  get  the  carrier-set  exchange  rate  overseas  when  using  your  card.  In  other  words,  your  bank  has  a  cash  EURUSD  of  $1.30  but  the  conversion  you  get  at  the  ATM  is  Visa's  rate,  hence  the  Visa  fee  (but  it's  typically  a  nicer  spread,  or  it's  sometimes  the  international  spot  rate  depending  on  the  circumstances,  due  to  the  overhead  of  electronic  transactions).  You  also  have  to  consider  the  ATM  charging  you  a  separate  fee  for  it's  own  operation.  In  essence,  the  fees  exist  to  pad  every  player  involved  except  you.  Some  cards  do  you  a  solid  by  advertising  $0  foreign  exchange  fees.  Unfortunately  these  cards  only  insulate  you  from  the  processing/flat  fees  and  you  may  still  fall  prey  to  the  fee  "hidden"  in  the  spread.  In  the  grander  scheme  of  things,  currency  exchange  is  a  retail  operation.  They  try  to  make  money  on  every  step  that  requires  them  to  expend  a  resource.  If  you  pay  10%  on  a  money  transaction,  this  differs  actually  very  little  from  the  mark-up  you  pay  on  your  groceries,  which  varies  from  3-5%  on  dry  food,  to  20%  on  alcohol  such  as  wine.
201280	Banks  do  of  course  incur  costs  on  currency  transactions.  But  they're  not  as  high  as  the  fee  charged  to  the  customer.  Most  banks  in  most  places  lose  a  lot  of  money  on  operating  bank  accounts  for  customers,  and  make  the  money  back  by  charging  more  than  their  costs  for  services  like  currency  exchange.  If  you  don't  choose  to  pay  those  fees,  use  an  online  service  instead.  But  bear  in  mind  that  if  everyone  does  so  then  banks  will  be  forced  to  charge  higher  fees  for  current  accounts.
441163	Is  there  not  some  central  service  that  tracks  current  currency  rates  that  banks  can  use  to  get  currency  data?  Sure.    But  this  doesn't  matter.    All  the  central  service  can  tell  you  is  how  much  the  rate  was  historically.    But  the  banks/PayPal  don't  care  about  the  historical  value.    They  want  to  know  the  price  that  they'll  pay  when  they  get  around  to  switching,  not  the  last  price  before  the  switch.    Beyond  that,  there  is  a  transaction  cost  to  switching.    They  have  to  pay  the  clearinghouse  for  managing  the  transaction.      The  banks  can  choose  to  act  as  a  clearinghouse,  but  that  increases  their  risk.    If  the  bank  has  a  large  balance  of  US  dollars  but  dollars  are  falling,  then  they  end  up  eating  that  cost.    They'll  only  take  that  risk  if  they  think  that  they'll  make  more  money  that  way.    And  in  the  end,  they  may  have  to  go  on  the  currency  market  anyway.    If  a  European  bank  runs  out  of  US  dollars,  they  have  to  buy  them  on  the  open  market.    Or  a  US  bank  might  run  out  of  Euros.    Or  Yen.    Etc.      Another  problem  is  that  many  of  the  currency  transactions  are  small,  but  the  overhead  is  fixed.    If  the  bank  has  to  pay  $5  for  every  currency  transaction,  they  won't  even  break  even  charging  3%  on  a  $100  transaction.    So  they  delay  the  actual  transaction  so  that  they  can  make  more  than  one  at  a  time.    But  then  they  have  the  risk  that  the  currency  value  might  change  in  the  meantime.    If  they  credit  you  with  $97  in  your  account  ($100  minus  the  3%  fee)  but  the  price  actually  drops  from  $100  to  $99,  they're  out  the  $1.      They  could  do  it  the  other  way  as  well.    You  ask  for  a  $100  transaction.    They  perform  a  $1000  transaction,  of  which  they  give  you  $97.    Now  they  have  $898  ($1000  minus  the  $5  they  paid  for  the  transaction  plus  the  $3  they  charged  you  for  the  transaction).    If  there's  a  1%  drop,  they're  out  $10.98  ($8.98  in  currency  loss  plus  a  net  $2  in  fees).      This  is  why  banks  have  money  market  accounts.    So  they  have  someone  to  manage  these  problems  working  twenty-four  hours  a  day.    But  then  they  have  to  pay  interest  on  those  accounts,  further  eating  into  their  profits.    Along  with  paying  a  staff  to  monitor  the  currency  markets  and  things  that  may  affect  them.
7411	Perhaps  it's  the  terminology  "fee"  that  makes  it  a  little  confusing.  I'm  not  sure  whether  it's  due  legislation  or  if  it's  tradition  but  banks  and  money  changers  in  my  country  don't  charge  "fees".  Instead  they  advertise  separate  prices  for  buying  and  selling  money.  For  example  they'd  normally  advertise:  USD,  we  buy:  4.50,  we  sell:  4.65.  It's  a  business.  Just  like  selling  cars  or  lemonade  selling  money  only  makes  sense  if  you  sell  it  at  a  higher  price  than  what  you  bought  it  for.  Regardless  of  what  you  call  it  it's  the  profit  margin  for  the  seller.
542075	Echoing  that  bank  fees  are  mostly  "because  they  can",  although  partly  this  is  because  simply  holding  onto  the  money  doesn't  really  pay  enough  for  the  physical  infrastructure  of  branches,  ATMs  and  staff.  So  like  a  budget  airline  they  make  it  up  on  additional  fees.  But  that  document  doesn't  actually  say  they  charge  3%  for  currency  conversion!  It's  "0.20%  of  transaction  amount"  for  currency  conversion,  which  is  not  bad  (although  watch  out  for  the  "spread"  between  buying  and  selling  rates).  I  see  "International  POS/ATM  Transaction  Fee  3%  of  transaction  amount",  which  is  very  different.  That's  a  card  fee.  The  big  issue  with  these  is  fraud  -  your  card  number  suddenly  being  used  in  a  different  country  will  nearly  always  trigger  extra  fraud  checks.  It  also  involves  a  much  more  complicated  settlement  process.  I'm  more  unimpressed  with  the  monthly  service  charges  and  the  huge  $85  fee  for  international  wire  transfers.
356465	As  mentioned  in  several  other  answers,  the  main  reason  for  high  rates  is  to  maximize  profit.  However,  here  is  another,  smaller  effect:  The  typical  flow  of  getting  money  from  an  ATM:  Suppose  you  have  a  minute  to  consider  the  offer,  then  in  that  time  the  currency  may  drop  or  rise  (which  you  can  see  from  an  external  source  of  information).  Therefore  this  opens  a  window  for  abuse.  For  real  major  currencies  these  huge  switches  are  rare,  but  they  do  happen.  And  when  1  or  2  minor  currencies  are  involved  these  switches  are  more  common.  Just  looking  at  a  random  pair  for  today  (Botswana  Pula  to  Haitian  Gourde)  I  immediately  spotted  a  moment  where  the  exchange  rate  jumped  by  more  than  2  %.  This  may  not  be  the  best  example,  but  it  shows  why  a  large  margin  is  desirable.  Note  that  this  argument  only  holds  for  when  the  customer  knows  in  advance  what  the  exchange  rate  would  be,  for  cases  where  it  is  calculated  afterwards  I  have  not  found  any  valid  excuse  for  such  large  margins  (except  that  it  allows  them  to  offer  other  services  at  a  lower  price  because  these  transaction).
514129	My  suggestion  would  be  that  you're  looking  at  this  the  wrong  way,  though  for  good  reasons.    Once  you  are  a  family,  you  should  -  and,  in  most  cases  I've  seen,  will  -  think  of  things  differently  than  you  do  now.  Right  now,  your  post  above  is  written  from  a  selfish  perspective.    Not  to  be  insulting,  and  not  implying  selfish  is  a  bad  thing  -  I  don't  mean  it  negatively.    But  it  is  how  you're  defining  this  problem:  from  a  self-interested,  selfish  point  of  view.    "Fair"  and  "unfair"  only  have  meaning  from  this  point  of  view;  something  can  only  be  unfair  to  you  if  you  come  from  a  self-centered  viewpoint.  Try  to  think  of  this  from  a  family-centric  viewpoint,  and  from  your  significant  other's  point  of  view.  You're  absolutely  right  to  want  both  of  you  to  be  independent  financially  as  far  as  is  possible;  but  think  about  what  that  means  from  all  three  points  of  view  (your  family's,  yours,  and  hers)?  Exactly  what  it  means  will  depend  on  the  two  of  you  separately  and  together,  but  I  would  encourage  you  to  start  with  a  few  basics  that  make  it  likely  you'll  find  a  common  ground:  First  of  all,  ensure  your  significant  other  has  a  retirement  account  of  her  own  that  is  funded  as  well  as  yours  is.    This  will  both  make  life  easier  if  you  split  up,  and  give  her  a  safety  net  if  something  happens  to  you  than  if  you  have  all  of  the  retirement  savings.    I  don't  know  how  your  country  manages  pensions  or  retirement  accounts,  but  figure  out  how  to  get  her  into  something  that  is  as  close  to  equal  to  yours  as  possible.  Make  sure  both  of  you  have  similar  quality  credit  histories.    You  should  both  have  credit  cards  in  your  own  names  (or  be  true  joint  owners  of  the  accounts,  not  just  authorized  users,  where  that  is  possible),  and  both  be  on  the  mortgage/etc.  when  possible.    This  is  a  common  issue  for  women  whose  spouse  dies  young  and  who  have  no  credit  history.    (Thanks  @KateGregory  for  reminding  me  on  this  one)  Beyond  that,  work  out  how  much  your  budget  allows  for  in  spending  money  for  the  two  of  you,  and  split  that  equally.    This  spending  money  (i.e.,  "fun  money"  or  money  you  can  do  whatever  you  like  with)  is  what  is  fundamentally  important  in  terms  of  financial  independence:  if  you  control  most  of  the  extra  money,  then  you're  the  one  who  ultimately  has  control  over  much  (vacations,  eating  out,  etc.)  and  things  will  be  strained.    This  money  should  be  equal  -  whether  it  is  literally  apportioned  directly  (each  of  you  has  200  a  month  in  an  account)  or  simply  budgeted  for  with  a  common  account  is  up  to  you,  whatever  works  best  for  your  personal  habits;  separate  accounts  works  well  for  many  here  to  keep  things  honest.  When  that  money  is  accounted  for,  whatever  it  is,  split  the  rest  of  the  bills  up  so  that  she  pays  some  of  them  from  her  income.    If  she  wants  to  be  independent,  some  of  that  is  being  in  the  habit  of  paying  bills  on  time.    One  of  you  paying  all  of  the  bills  is  not  optimal  since  it  means  the  other  will  not  build  good  habits.    For  example,  my  wife  pays  the  warehouse  club  credit  card  and  the  cell  phone  bill,  while  I  pay  the  gas/electric  utilities.  Whatever  doesn't  go  to  spending  money  and  doesn't  go  to  the  bills  she's  personally  responsible  for  or  you're  responsible  for  (from  your  paycheck)  should  go  to  a  joint  account.    That  joint  account  should  pay  the  larger  bills  -  mortgage/rent,  in  particular  -  and  common  household  expenses,  and  both  of  you  should  have  visibility  on  it.    For  example,  our  mortgage,  day-care  costs,  major  credit  card  (which  includes  most  of  our  groceries  and  other  household  expenses)  come  from  that  joint  account.  This  kind  of  system,  where  you  each  have  equal  money  to  spend  and  each  have  some  household  responsibilities,  seems  the  most  reasonable  to  me:  it  incurs  the  least  friction  over  money,  assuming  everyone  sticks  to  their  budgeted  amounts,  and  prevents  one  party  from  being  able  to  hold  power  over  another.  It's  a  system  that  seems  likely  to  be  best  for  the  family  as  a  unit.    It's  not  "fair"  from  a  self-centered  point  of  view,  but  is  quite  fair  from  a  family-centered  point  of  view,  and  that  is  the  right  point  of  view  when  you  are  a  family,  in  my  opinion.  I'll  emphasize  here  also  that  it  is  important  that  no  one  party  hold  the  power,  and  this  is  set  up  to  avoid  that,  but  it's  also  important  that  you  not  use  your  earning  power  as  a  major  arguing  point  in  this  system.    You're  not  "funding  her  lifestyle"  or  anything  like  that:  you're  supporting  your  family,  just  as  she  is.    If  she  were  earning  more  than  you,  would  you  cut  your  hours  and  stay  at  home?    Trick  question,  as  it  happens;  regardless  of  your  answer  to  that  question,  you're  still  at  the  same  point:  both  of  you  are  doing  the  thing  you're  best  suited  for  (or,  the  thing  you  prefer).    You're  both  supporting  the  family,  just  in  different  ways,  and  suggesting  that  your  contribution  is  more  valuable  than  hers  is  a  great  way  to  head  down  the  road  to  divorce:  it's  also  just  plain  incorrect.    My  wife  and  I  are  in  almost  the  identical  situation  -  2  kids,  she  works  part  time  in  the  biological  sciences  while  spending  plenty  of  time  with  the  kids,  I'm  a  programmer  outearning  her  significantly  -  and  I  can  tell  you  that  I'd  more  than  happily  switch  roles  if  she  were  the  bread  earner,  and  would  feel  just  as  satisfied  if  not  more  doing  so.  And,  I  can  imagine  myself  in  that  position,  so  I  can  also  imagine  how  I'd  feel  in  that  position  as  far  as  how  I  value  my  contribution.
386720	You  remind  me  a  lot  of  myself  as  I  was  thinking  about  marriage.  Luckily  for  me,  my  wife  was  much  smarter  about  all  this  than  I  was.  Hopefully,  I  can  pass  along  some  of  her  wisdom.  Both  of  us  feel  very  strongly  about  being  financially  independent  and  if  possible  we  both  don't  want  to  take  money  from  each  other.  In  marriage,  there  is  no  more  financial  independence.  Do  not  think  in  those  terms.  Life  can  throw  so  many  curve  balls  that  you  will  regret  it.  Imagine  sitting  down  with  your  new  bride  and  running  through  the  math.  She  is  to  contribute  $X  to  the  family  each  month  and  you  are  to  contribute  $Y.  Then  next  thing  you  know,  6  months  later,  she  has  cancer  and  has  to  undergo  expensive  and  debilitating  treatment.  There  is  no  way  she  can  contribute  her  $X  anymore.  You  tell  her  that  is  okay  and  that  you  understand,  but  the  pressure  weighs  down  on  her  every  day  because  she  feels  like  she  is  not  meeting  your  expectations.    Or  alternatively,  everything  goes  great  with  your  $X,  $Y  plan.  A  few  years  down  the  road  your  wife  is  pregnant,  so  you  revisit  the  plan,  readjust,  etc.  Everything  seems  great.  When  your  child  is  born,  however,  the  baby  has  a  severe  physical  or  mental  handicap.  You  and  your  wife  decide  that  she  will  quit  her  job  to  raise  your  beautiful  child.  But,  the  whole  time,  in  the  back  of  her  mind  she  can't  get  out  of  her  head  that  she  is  no  longer  financially  independent  and  not  living  up  to  your  expectations.  These  stresses  are  not  what  you  want  in  your  marriage.  Here  is  what  we  do  in  my  family.  Hopefully,  some  of  this  will  be  helpful  to  you.  Every  year  my  wife  and  I  sit  down  and  determine  what  our  financial  goals  are  for  the  year.  How  much  do  we  want  to  be  putting  in  retirement?  How  much  do  we  want  to  give  to  charity?  Do  we  want  to  take  any  family  vacations?  We  set  goals  together  on  what  we  want  to  achieve  with  our  money.  There  is  no  my  money  or  her  money,  just  ours.  Doesn't  matter  where  it  comes  from.  At  the  beginning  of  every  month,  we  create  a  budget  in  a  spreadsheet.  It  has  categories  like  (food,  mortgage  or  rent,  transportation,  clothing,  utilities)  and  we  put  down  how  much  we  expect  to  spend  on  each  of  those.  It  also  has  categories  for  entertainment,  retirement,  charity,  cell  phones,  internet,  and  so  on.  Again,  we  put  down  how  much  we  expect  to  spend  on  each  of  those.  In  the  spreadsheet,  we  also  track  how  much  income  we  expect  that  month  and  our  totals  (income  minus  expenses).  If  that  value  is  positive,  we  determine  what  to  do  with  the  remainder.  Maybe  we  save  some  for  a  rainy  day  or  for  car  repairs.  Maybe  we  treat  ourselves  to  an  extra  fancy  dinner.  The  point  is,  every  dollar  should  be  accounted  for.  If  she  wants  to  go  to  dinner  with  some  friends,  we  put  that  in  the  budget.  If  I  want  a  new  video  game,  we  put  that  in  the  budget.  Once  a  week,  we  take  all  our  receipts  and  tally  up  where  we  spent  our  money.  We  then  see  how  we  are  doing  on  our  budget.  Maybe  we  were  a  little  high  in  one  category  and  lower  than  expected  in  another.  We  adjust.  We  are  flexible.  But,  we  go  over  our  finances  often  to  make  sure  we  are  achieving  our  goals.  Some  specific  goals  I'd  recommend  that  the  two  of  you  consider  in  your  first  such  yearly  meeting:  You  get  out  of  life  what  you  put  into  it,  and  you  will  get  out  of  your  finances  what  the  two  of  you  put  into  them.  By  being  on  the  same  page,  your  marriage  will  be  much  happier.  Money/finances  are  one  of  the  top  causes  of  divorce.  If  you  two  are  working  together  on  this,  you  are  much  more  likely  to  succeed.
366444	I  started  out  thinking  like  you  but  I  quickly  realised  this  was  a  bad  approach.  You  are  a  team,  aren't  you?  Are  you  equals  or  is  one  of  you  an  inferior  of  lower  value?  I  think  you'll  generate  more  shared  happiness  by  acting  as  a  team  of  equals.  I'd  pool  your  resources  and  share  them  as  equals.  I'd  open  a  joint  account  and  pay  both  your  incomes  directly  into  it.  I'd  pay  all  household  bills  from  this.    If  you  feel  the  need,  have  separate  personal  savings  accounts  paid  into  (equally)  from  the  joint  account.    Major  assets  should  be  in  joint  names.  This  usually  means  the  house.  In  my  experience,  it  is  a  good  idea  to  each  have  a  small  amount  of  individual  savings  that  you  jointly  agree  each  can  spend  without  consulting  the  other,  even  if  the  other  thinks  it  is  a  shocking  waste  of  money.  However,  spending  of  joint  savings  should  only  be  by  mutual  agreement.  I  would  stop  worrying  about  who  is  bringing  in  the  most  income.  Are  you  planning  to  gestate  your  children?  How  much  is  that  worth?  -  My  advice  is  to  put  all  this  aside,  stop  trying  to  track  who  adds  what  value  to  the  joint  venture  and  make  it  a  partnership  of  equals  where  each  contributes  whatever  they  can.  Suppose  you  fell  ill  and  were  unable  to  earn.  Should  you  wife  then  retain  all  her  income  and  keep  you  in  poverty?  I  really  believe  life  is  simpler  and  happier  without  adding  complex  and  stressful  financial  issues  to  the  relationship.  Of  course,  everyone  is  different.  The  main  thing  is  to  agree  this  between  the  two  of  you  and  be  open  to  change  and  compromise.
273390	I  haven't  seen  this  addressed  anywhere  else,  so  I'll  make  a  small  answer  to  add  on  to  the  great  ones  already  here.  Money  isn't  the  only  way  a  person  can  contribute  to  a  relationship.  Time  and  effort  are  valuable  contributions.  Who  runs  the  household?  Who  cooks,  cleans,  does  laundry?  How  will  you  share  these  duties?  My  husband  and  I  have  a  couple  of  rules.  One  of  which  is  that  we  don't  keep  count.  "I  did  dishes,  so  you  do  laundry".  "I  made  coffee  last  time,  so  now  it's  your  turn".  "I  paid  this,  so  you  pay  that".  That's  not  allowed.    I  happen  to  make  ~4x  as  much  as  my  husband,  but  I  work  4x  the  hours  (he's  part  time  at  the  moment).  So,  he  does  the  dishes,  he  cooks,  he  does  laundry,  he  runs  the  household.  Do  I  value  him  less?  No!  I  value  him  more,  because  he  is  part  of  the  team,  and  he  feeds  me  coffee  while  I  work  (we  have  our  own  business).  Even  though  I  make  so  much  more  than  him,  we  still  split  everything  down  the  middle.  Because  his  contribution  to  this  relationship,  to  this  household,  is  so  much  more  than  just  money.  And  I  value  him.  I  value  his  contribution.    At  the  end  of  the  day,  you  are  a  team  -  and  if  you  split  hairs  over  finances,  you'll  find  yourself  splitting  hairs  over  everything.
91147	Now  I  have  been  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  split  the  money  that  we  both  earn.  From  what  I  can  see  there  are  several  concepts  but  none  of  them  really  seems  ideal  to  me.  There  is  nothing  fair  or  unfair  in  such  arrangements.  It  is  what  you  both  agree.  You  can  try  and  make  this  as  scientific  as  possible.  But  then  there  is  no  golden  rule.    For  example,  your  girlfriend  makes  2200  now  and  due  to  child,  she  is  making  1100.  The  child  is  both  of  your  responsibility;  so  you  need  to  compensate  half  of  her  salary  loss.  550  and  she  takes  the  other  half.  If  you  hire  a  nanny  to  look  after  you  kinds,  it  would  say  cost  you  500.  But  your  girlfriend  is  doing  that  job,  so  she  should  get  additional  500  from  common  pot.  Plus  due  to  loss  of  few  years  in  looking  after  the  children,  she  has  a  lost  opportunity  in  career  growth.  i.e.  she  may  indefinitely  make  less  money  than  she  can...  So  one  gets  into  all  kinds  of  theories  and  analysis  and  any  arrangements  will  have  some  or  the  other  gaps.    So  my  suggestion,  don't  get  too  scientific  about  it.  Just  talk  it  out  as  to  what  you  both  feel  how  this  should  be  and  arrive  it.  It  is  something  every  individual  has  to  agree.  It  also  make  sense  to  have  the  large  assets  [or  assets  that  matter],  like  house,  car  etc  in  clear  title  and  who  gets  what  in  case  you  decide  to  separate.  Other  should  be  incidental.
581675	I  started  this  off  as  a  comment  to  Joe's  answer,  but  it  got  rather  messy  in  that  form  so  I'll  just  post  it  as  a  separate  answer  instead.  I  suggest  that  you  read  Joe's  answer  first.  I  believe  you  are  overthinking  this.  First,  you  really  should  be  discussing  the  matter  with  your  girlfriend.  We  can  provide  suggestions,  but  only  the  two  of  you  can  decide  what  feels  right  for  the  two  of  you.  Strangers  on  the  Internet  can  never  have  as  complete  a  picture  of  your  financial  situations,  your  plans,  and  your  personalities,  as  the  two  of  you  together.  That  said,  here's  a  starting  point  that  I  would  use  as  input  to  such  a  discussion:  As  you  can  see,  a  common  theme  to  all  of  this  is  transparency  and  communication.  There  is  a  reason  for  this:  a  marriage  without  proper  communication  can  never  work  out  well  in  the  long  term.  I  don't  know  about  Germany  specifically,  but  disagreements  about  money  tends  to  be  a  major  reason  in  couples  splitting  up.  By  setting  your  lives  up  for  transparency  in  money  matters  from  the  beginning,  you  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of  this  happening  to  you.  Scott  Hanselman  discusses  a  very  similar  way  of  doing  things,  but  phrases  it  differently,  in  Relationship  Hacks:  An  Allowance  System  for  Adults.
289002	I  won't  answer  in  a  detailed  manner  because  most  people  at  this  site  like  answers  with  certain  bias'  on  these  questions,  like  pool  resources  always  relative  to  which  partner  is  asking.    If  you  follow  the  above  advice,  you  are  hoping  things  work  out.    Great!    What  if  they  don't?    It  will  be  very  messy.    Unlike  most  of  my  peers,  I  did  NOT  follow  the  above  advice  and  had  a  very  clean  exit  with  both  of  us  feeling  very  good  (and  no  lawyers  got  involved  either;  win-win  for  both  of  us  with  all  the  money  we  saved).  One  assumption  people  make  is  the  person  with  the  lowest  income  has  the  strictest  limits.    This  is  not  always  true;  I  grew  up  in  poverty,  but  have  a  very  high  income  and  detest  financial  waste.    I  can  live  on  about  €12,000  a  year  and  even  though  my  partner  made  a  little  less,  my  partner  liked  to  spend.      Counter  intuitive,  right?    I  was  supposed  to  be  the  spender  because  I  had  a  large  income,  but  I  wasn't.    Also,  think  about  an  example  with  food  -  sharing  expenses.    Is  it  fair  for  one  partner  to  split  whey  protein  if  one  partner  consumes  it,  but  the  other  doesn't  (answer:  in  my  view,  no)?  My  advice  based  on  your  questions:  Balance  the  frugal  vs.  spendthrift  mentality  rather  than  income  ratios.    If  you're  both  frugal,  then  focus  on  income  ratios  -  but  one  may  be  more  frugal  than  the  other  and  the  thought  of  spending  €300  a  month  on  housing  is  just  insane  to  a  person  like  me,  whereas  to  most  it's  too  little.    Are  you  both  exactly  the  same  with  this  mentality  -  and  be  honest?  Common  costs  that  you  both  agree  on  can  be  easily  split  50-50  and  you  can  often  benefit  from  economies  of  scale  (like  internet,  cell  phone).  Both  of  us  feel  very  strongly  about  being  financially  independent  and  if  possible  we  both  don't  want  to  take  money  from  each  other.  This  is  so  healthy  for  a  relationship.    My  partner  and  I  split  and  we  both  still  really  love  each  other.    We're  headed  in  different  directions,  but  we  did  not  want  to  end  bitterly.    What  you  wrote  is  part  of  why  we  ended  so  well;  we  both  were  very  independent  financially.      Kids  are  going  to  be  a  challenge  because  they  come  with  expenses  that  partners  don't  always  agree  on.    What  do  you  and  her  think  of  childcare,  for  instance?    You  really  want  to  know  all  this  upfront;  again  a  frugal  vs.  spendthrift  mindset  could  cause  some  big  tensions.
352613	I  think  you  have  succumbed  to  a  category  error.  The  rational  course  forward  is  to  classify  all  property  as  either  his,  hers,  or  family's.  Each  contributes  a  portion  of  wages  to  the  family.  Each  logs  hours  spent  performing  familial  duties  and  is  "paid"  in  virtual  dollars  into  their  family  account  at  market  rates  for  that  service.  At  any  point  actual  plus  virtual  dollars  are  summed  to  assess  the  value  of  the  family  and  percentages  are  allocated  to  each  party  on  this  basis.  Put  this  into  a  pre-nuptual  agreement.    At  the  time  of  the  inevitable  divorce  you  leave  with  yours,  she  leaves  with  hers,  family's  assets  are  divided  as  described,  and  division  of  children  should  be  as  King  Solomon  suggested.  Or  you  could  do  what  I  did:  Put  all  your  property  (and  debts)  into  one  pot.  Make  sure  each  partner  can  competently  manage  bookkeeping  and  investments.  Accumulate  a  family  net  worth  sufficient  to  divide  in  two  and  each  have  financial  independence.  (I'm  working  on  this  last  step.)
269401	I  can  only  share  with  you  my  happened  with  my  wife  and  I.  First,  and  foremost,  if  you  think  you  need  to  protect  your  assets  for  some  reason  then  do  so.  Be  open  and  honest  about  it.  If  we  get  a  divorce,  X  stays  with  me,  and  Y  stays  with  you.    This  seems  silly,  even  when  your  doing  it,  but  it's  important.  You  can  speak  with  a  lawyer  about  this  stuff  as  you  need  to,  but  get  it  in  writing.  Now  I  know  this  seems  like  planning  for  failure,  but  if  you  feel  that  foo  is  important  to  you,  and  you  want  to  retain  ownership  of  foo  no  mater  what,  then  you  have  to  do  this  step.  It  also  works  both  ways.  You  can  use,  with  some  limitations,  this  to  insulate  your  new  family  unit  from  your  personal  risks.  For  example,  my  business  is  mine.  If  we  break  up  it  stays  mine.  The  income  is  shared,  but  the  business  is  mine.  This  creates  a  barrier  that  if  someone  from  10  years  ago  sues  my  business,  then  my  wife  is  protected  from  that.  Keep  in  mind,  different  countries  different  rules.  Next,  and  this  is  my  advise.  Give  up  on  "his  and  hers"  everything.  It's  just  "ours".  Together  you  make  5400€  decide  how  to  spend  5400€  together.  Pick  your  goals  together.  The  pot  is  5400€.  End  of  line.  It  doesn't  matter  how  much  from  one  person  or  how  much  from  another  (unless  your  talking  about  mitigating  losses  from  sick  days  or  injuries  or  leave  etc.).  All  that  matters  is  that  you  make  5400€.  Start  your  budgeting  there.    Next  setup  an  equal  allowance.  That  is  money,  set  aside  for  non-sense  reasons.  I  like  to  buy  video  games,  my  wife  likes  to  buy  books.  This  is  not  for  vacation,  or  stuff  together,  but  just  little,  tiny  stuff  you  can  do  for  your  self,  without  asking    "permission".  The  number  should  be  small,  and  equal.  Maybe  50€.    Finally  setup  a  budget.  House  Stuff  200€,  Car  stuff  400€.  etc.  etc.  then  it  doesn't  matter  who  bought  the  house  stuff.  You  only  have  to  coordinate  so  that  you  don't  both  buy  house  stuff.  After  some  time  (took  us  around  6  months)  you  will  find  out  how  this  works  and  you  can  add  on  some  rules.  For  example,  I  don't  go  to  Best  Buy  alone.  I  will  spend  too  much  on  "house  stuff".  My  wife  doesn't  like  to  make  the  budget,  so  I  handle  that,  then  we  go  over  it.  Things  like  that.
170871	My  own  personal  point  of  view.  I  earn  about  twice  what  my  wife  to  be  earns.  We  are  planning  on  getting  married  next  year.    I  ultimately  do  all  the  finances  (basically  because  she  hates  that  kind  of  thing)  not  because  I'm  in  charge  or  whatever.  To  work  out  how  we  do  this  I  wrote  a  spreadsheet:    At  the  top  it  has  my  monthly  pay  in  one  column  and  her's  in  another.  I  add  all  our  bills  (against  me  initally).  At  the  bottom  I  have  a  total  of  both  of  our  "spending  money".  Spending  money  is  wage  -  bills  -  savings  I  then  move  money  out  of  my  column  into  her  column.  My  goal  is  that  we  pay  all  the  bills  and  save  a  decent  amount  and  have  roughly  the  same  amount  to  spend  each  month.  So  each  persons  spending  money  should  be  roughly  equal.  I  then  fine  tune  this  as  things  change  (if  we  get  a  pay  rise  we  alter  it,  if  a  bill  goes  up  or  down  we  alter  it)  To  manage  this  we  have  4  accounts,  a  joint  account  to  pay  bills  (both  give  a  set  amount  to  each  mont),  a  savings  acount  (both  give  a  set  amount  to  each  month)  and  our  own  accounts  (where  we  get  paid  and  where  our  spending  money  lives).  Like  everyone  else  says,  this  seems  fair  to  me.  I  don't  earn  more,  we  both  earn  "an  amount"  and  this  should  be  split  equally.
392660	You  currently  have  5400€  between  you  and  2600€  expenses  leaving  you  2800€.  You  currently  keep  1900€  and  she  keeps  900€  at  the  end  of  each  month  splitting  68/32.  If  you  marry  and  have  a  child,  your  combined  income  will  go  down  to  4900€  while  your  expenses  will  increase  by  300€  to  2900€  leaving  2000€.  You  could  continue  to  split  68/32  leaving  you  1360€  and  her  640€.  If  you  use  this  split  you  will  lose  540€  and  she  will  lose  260€.  That's  a  28%  loss  for  you  and  a  28%  loss  for  her  from  your  end  of  month  take  home.  So  far  it  sounds  reasonably  fair.  What  about  the  future?  For  each  raise,  the  person  getting  the  raise  keeps  66%  of  their  raises.  If  you  get  the  majority  of  the  raises,  you  keep  the  majority  of  the  benefit,  but  both  benefit  from  the  increase.  Any  future  increases  in  expenses  can  be  split  as  negotiated  based  on  who  benefits  from  those  increases.  That's  basically  what  you  are  doing  now  considering  that  adding  a  child  will  cost  a  lot  of  her  time,  not  just  your  money.
549868	Some  basic  thoughts,  mostly  on  fairness.  I  guess  the  answer  doesn't  really  fit  this  site,  it's  more  about  ethics,  but  this  fits  the  question  which  isn't  really  just  about  money  either.  So  when  both  work  the  same  amount,  it  seems  appropriate  that  both  get  the  same  mount  of  money,  doesn't  it?  That  is,  the  scheme  of  (as  already  contained  in  your  question  and  in  some  other  answers)  is  fair  by  this  logic.  Pay  attention  to  hidden  money:  for  example  the  one  who  works  more  for  money  might  automatically  get  a  pension  funded  this  way.  This  is  hidden  money  which  already  goes  to  only  one  partner,  so  when  dividing  equally,  you'll  need  to  take  that  into  account  (or  just  include  "equal  pensions  for  both"  in  the  family's  needs  directly).
506991	This  would  be  my  suggestion:  I  would  approach  the  problem  thinking  about  the  loss  of  monthly  income  you  (as  a  couple)  will  be  facing  due  to  your  wife's  change  to  a  part  time  job  and  divide  that  loss  between  the  two  of  you.  This  means  that  if  she  goes  from  2200  to  1100  monthly,  you'd  be  losing  1100  per  month.    To  share  this  loss,  you  could  repay  your  wife  your  part  of  the  loss  (550)  so  both  of  you  are  550  euro  down.  However,  this  550  loss  is  a  bigger  burden  for  your  wife  than  it  is  for  you,  so  this  amount  could  be  adjusted  to  make  up  for  this  inequality.    To  make  calculations  simple  and  avoid  developing  a  complicated  model,  you  could  give  the  800  euro  above  your  3k  to  your  wife  for  as  long  as  she  has  to  work  part  time.
348353	What  equal  percentage  of  both  you  and  your  girlfriend's  income  will  cover  the  essential  household  expenses?  Although  we  earned  different  amounts,  both  of  us  turned  over  half  our  income  over  to  the  household.    Between  us  this  percentage  slice  from  each  of  our  earnings  neatly  covered  all  the  essentials.    The  amounts  contributed  were  different,  but  the  contributions  where  nonetheless  equal.  Beyond  this  the  financial  relationship  was  fast  and  loose.
177362	The  bottom  line  is  choosing  the  right  partner.  If  your  partner  works  as  hard  as  you  do,  than  everything  should  be  split,  irregardless  of  who  makes  more.  Unfortunately,  my  bf,  now  by  separated  husband,  borrowed  money  from  me  before  we  were  married.  I  saw  a  lack  of  work  ethic  in  him  from  the  beginning,  loved  him  anyway  and  married  him  but  decided  to  keep  my  money  separate  as  a  result.  This  was  a  beginning  with  lack  of  trust  and  knowing  I  would  be  the  higher  earner,  harder  worker,  and  better  provider.  Down  the  road  he  won  a  lawsuit  and  got  about  $700k.  I  saw  about  $25k  of  this  money  to  pay  bills  created  with  the  intention  of  him  paying  them  off  when  he  got  the  money,  and  because  he  pilfered  it  away,  we  lost  our  house  and  it  ended  in  my  leaving....  I'm  still  doing  ok  because  I  work  hard  for  what  I  have.  He  is  struggling.  We  were  never  on  the  same  page,  never  discussed  finances  because  of  his  lack  of  work  ethic  and  my  mistrust  of  how  he  would  decide  how  the  money  would  be  used.  Sadly,  who  you  decide  to  be  your  partner  is  the  most  important  decision  here...It  should  be  based  on  mutual  respect,  both  working  hard  to  achieve  a  common  goal,  and  communicating  the  budget  every  year,  perhaps  even  each  month....  I'm  the  terrible  example.
368315	I  think  the  problem  is  that  you've  made  a  math  error.  This  child  would  not  be  costing  you  300  per  month,  it  will  be  costing  you  1400  per  month.    1100  of  this  is  in  a  donation  of  salable  hours  rather  than  cash,  but  helpfully  you  have  a  number  right  there  as  to  how  much  someone  is  willing  to  pay  for  these  hours  so  the  math  is  still  doable.  So,  if  you  are  indeed  splitting  your  expenses  fifty-fifty,  you  should  chip  1100  into  the  pot  to  match  your  wife's  contribution.    It  would  make  the  most  sense,  I  think,  to  have  your  part  of  this  contribution  cover  some  of  your  mutual  expenses,  and  if  any  is  left  over,  save  it  up  for  the  day  that  your  child  would  cost  more  than  that  300  in  a  month  -  when  you  need  extra  clothes,  or  have  to  replace  something  they  destroyed,  or  want  to  pay  for  extra  opportunities  (camps,  educational  games,  lessons),  or  a  a  savings  that  can  be  used  for  major  future  expenses  (higher  education,  first  car,  milestone  celebrations,  safety  net  when  starting  out).  Of  course,  if  your  family  is  indeed  a  priority,  you  might  consider  making  an  equal  investment  in  your  family  -  say,  half  your  income  (1800)  to  match  half  her  time  going  into  the  building  of  the  family.    After  all,  the  decision  to  start  a  family  should  be  an  investment  of  time  and  value,  not  just  a  minimum  bid  for  expenses.    And  again,  any  extra  can  be  spent  on  mutual  expenses,  saved  up  for  future  costs,  or  left  as  your  child's  "savings"  for  major  expenses  or  safety  net.  I  suppose  I  should  mention  that  you  perhaps  could  get  away  with  covering  half  her  contribution  (550  per  month,  on  the  face  of  it),  as  that  should  also  "balance"  out  the  monthly  expenses.    Even  this  much  would  be  enough  to  put  her  back  into  the  green  on  her  covering  her  own  costs.    Of  course,  in  this  case  you  might  want  to  take  into  account  that  while  she's  working  38,5  hours  per  week  now,  running  a  household  is,  I've  heard,  more  closely  equivalent  to  a  60-hour  week,  plus  or  minus  being  "on  call"  for  a  further  100  hours  a  week.    Trying  to  calculate  the  absolute  minimum  payment  on  your  part  to  match  the  investment  of  hours  on  hers  is  likely  to  be  a  bit  more  tricky  than  just  matching  the  salable  hours  not  worked,  if  you're  set  on  income  ratios  and  splitting  costs  "as  they  are".  Also,  you  might  want  to  rethink  your  criteria  for  sharing  income  completely  or  what  makes  certain  divisions  of  costs  "unfair".  You  mention  one  reason  it  would  be  unfair  is  that  you  have  a  "more  stressful  job"  -  well,  your  job  may  well  be  more  stressful  than  her  job  now,  but  it  is  likely  to  be  less  so  than  raising  a  child  (her  new  job).    As  for  investment  of  time  and  energy  for  your  education  entitling  you  to  a  larger  amount  of  pay,  again,  raising  a  child  is  likely  to  be  a  larger  investment  of  time,  money,  and  anxiety  than  your  education,  but  her  pay  (or  even  share  of  the  costs)  doesn't  seem  to  be  balanced  in  response.    I'm  not  gonna  tell  you  what  is  fair,  that's  for  you  to  work  out,  just  suggesting  you  really  think  it  through  before  deciding  what  would  be  fair  or  not.
20076	The  shareholders  have  a  claim  on  the  profits,  but  they  may  prefer  that  claim  to  be  exercised  in  ways  other  than  dividend  payments.  For  example,  they  may  want  the  company  to  invest  all  of  its  profits  in  growth,  or  they  may  want  it  to  buy  back  shares  to  increase  the  value  of  the  remaining  shares,  especially  since  dividends  are  generally  taxed  as  income  while  an  increase  in  the  share  price  is  generally  taxed  as  a  capital  gain,  and  capital  gains  are  often  taxed  at  a  lower  rate  than  income.
147025	Cash  flow  is  needed  for  expansion,  either  to  increase  manufacturing  capacity  or  to  expand  the  workforce.  Other  times  companies  use  it  to  purchase  other  companies.  Microsoft  and  Google  have  both  used  their  cash  or  stocks  to  purchase  companies.  Examples  by  Google  include  YouTube,  Keyhole  (Google  Earth),  and  now  part  of  Motorola  to  expand  into  Phones.  If  you  are  investing  for  the  future,  you  don't  want  a  lot  of  dividends.  They  do  bring  tax  issues.  That  is  not  a  big  problem  if  you  are  investing  in  an  IRA  or  401K.  It  is  an  issue  if  the  non-tax-defered  mutual  fund  distributes  those  dividends  via  the  1099,  forcing  you  to  address  it  on  your  taxes  each  year.  Some  investors  do  like  dividends,  but  they  are  looking  for  their  investments  to  generate  cash.  Who  would  require  it?  Would  it  be  an  SEC  requirement?  Even  more  government  paperwork  for  companies.
407505	This  answer  will  expand  a  bit  on  the  theory.  :)  A  company,  as  an  entity,  represents  a  pile  of  value.  Some  of  that  is  business  value  (the  revenue  stream  from  their  products)  and  some  of  that  is  assets  (real  estate,  manufacturing  equipment,  a  patent  portfolio,  etc).  One  of  those  assets  is  cash.  If  you  own  a  share  in  the  company,  you  own  a  share  of  all  those  assets,  including  the  cash.  In  a  theoretical  sense,  it  doesn't  really  matter  whether  the  company  holds  the  cash  instead  of  you.  If  the  company  adds  an  extra  $1  billion  to  its  assets,  then  people  who  buy  and  sell  the  company  will  think  "hey,  there's  an  extra  $1  billion  of  cash  in  that  company;  I  should  be  willing  to  pay  $1  billion  /  shares  outstanding  more  per  share  to  own  it  than  I  would  otherwise."  Granted,  you  may  ultimately  want  to  turn  your  ownership  into  cash,  but  you  can  do  that  by  selling  your  shares  to  someone  else.  From  a  practical  standpoint,  though,  the  company  doesn't  benefit  from  holding  that  cash  for  a  long  time.  Cash  doesn't  do  much  except  sit  in  bank  accounts  and  earn  pathetically  small  amounts  of  interest,  and  if  you  wanted  pathetic  amounts  of  interests  from  your  cash  you  wouldn't  be  owning  shares  in  a  company,  you'd  have  it  in  a  bank  account  yourself.  Really,  the  company  should  do  something  with  their  cash.  Usually  that  means  investing  it  in  their  own  business,  to  grow  and  expand  that  business,  or  to  enhance  profitability.  Sometimes  they  may  also  purchase  other  companies,  if  they  think  they  can  turn  a  profit  from  the  purchase.  Sometimes  there  aren't  a  lot  of  good  options  for  what  to  do  with  that  money.  In  that  case,  the  company  should  say,  "I  can't  effectively  use  this  money  in  a  way  which  will  grow  my  business.  You  should  go  and  invest  it  yourself,  in  whatever  sort  of  business  you  think  makes  sense."  That's  when  they  pay  a  dividend.  You'll  see  that  a  lot  of  the  really  big  global  companies  are  the  ones  paying  dividends  -  places  like  Coca-Cola  or  Exxon-Mobil  or  what-have-you.  They  just  can't  put  all  their  cash  to  good  use,  even  after  their  growth  plans.  Many  people  who  get  dividends  will  invest  them  in  the  stock  market  again  -  possibly  purchasing  shares  of  the  same  company  from  someone  else,  or  possibly  purchasing  shares  of  another  company.  It  doesn't  usually  make  a  lot  of  sense  for  the  company  to  invest  in  the  stock  market  themselves,  though.  Investment  expertise  isn't  really  something  most  companies  are  known  for,  and  because  a  company  has  multiple  owners  they  may  have  differing  investment  needs  and  risk  tolerance.  For  instance,  if  I  had  a  bunch  of  money  from  the  stock  market  I'd  put  it  in  some  sort  of  growth  stock  because  I'm  twenty-something  with  a  lot  of  savings  and  years  to  go  before  retirement.  If  I  were  close  to  retirement,  though,  I  would  want  it  in  a  more  stable  stock,  or  even  in  bonds.  If  I  were  retired  I  might  even  spend  it  directly.  So  the  company  should  let  all  its  owners  choose,  unless  they  have  a  good  business  reason  not  to.  Sometimes  companies  will  do  share  buy-backs  instead  of  dividends,  which  pays  money  to  people  selling  the  company  stock.  The  remaining  owners  benefit  by  reducing  the  number  of  shares  outstanding,  so  they  own  more  of  what's  left.  They  should  only  do  this  if  they  think  the  stock  is  at  a  fair  price,  or  below  a  fair  price,  for  the  company:  otherwise  the  remaining  owners  are  essentially  giving  away  cash.  (This  actually  happens  distressingly  often.)  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  company's  stock  is  depressed  but  it  subsequently  does  better  than  the  rest  of  the  market,  then  it  is  a  very  good  investment.  The  one  nice  thing  about  share  buy-backs  in  general  is  that  they  don't  have  any  immediate  tax  implications  for  the  company's  owners:  they  simply  own  a  stock  which  is  now  more  valuable,  and  can  sell  it  (and  pay  taxes  on  that  sale)  whenever  they  choose.
55920	You  have  plenty  of  good  answers,  but  I  want  to  add  something  that  might  help  you  grow  your  intuition  on  stocks.  There  are  a  lot  of  differences  between  the  example  I  am  going  to  give  and  how  the  stock  market  actually  runs,  but  the  basic  concepts  are  the  same.  Lets  say  your  friend  asks  you  if  he  can  borrow  some  money  to  start  up  a  company,  in  exchange  you  will  have  some  ownership  in  this  company.  You  have  essentially  just  bought  yourself  some  stock.  Now  as  your  friend  starts  to  grow,  he  is  doing  well,  but  he  needs  more  cash  to  buy  assets  in  order  to  grow  the  company  more.  He  is  forced  with  an  option,  either  give  you  some  of  the  profits,  or  buy  these  assets  sooner.  You  decide  you  don't  really  need  the  money  right  now,  and  think  he  can  do  a  lot  better  with  spending  the  money  to  buy  stuff.  This  is  essentially  the  same  as  a  company  electing  to  not  pay  dividends,  but  instead  invest  into  the  future.  You  as  a  stock  holder  are  fine  with  it  since  you  know  the  money  is  going  toward  investing  in  the  future.  Even  if  you  never  get  paid  a  dividend,  as  a  company  grows,  you  can  then  turn  around  and  sell  the  stock  to  someone  else  for  more  money  then  you  gave  originally.  Of  course  you  always  take  the  risk  of  having  the  company  failing  and  loosing  some  if  not  all  of  your  investment,  but  that  is  just  the  risk  of  the  market.
582908	I'm  not  positive  my  answer  is  complete,  but  from  information  on  my  broker's  website,  the  following  fees  apply  to  a  US  option  trade  (which  I  assume  you're  concerned  with  given  fee  in  dollars  and  the  mention  of  the  Options  Clearing  Corporation):  They  have  more  detail  for  other  countries  --  see  https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/en/index.php?f=commission&p=options1  for  North  America.    Use  the  sub-menu  near  the  top  of  the  page  to  pick  Europe  or  Asia.  The  brokerage-charged  commission  for  this  broker  is  as  low  as  $0.25  per  contract  with  a  $1.00  minimum.    Though  I've  been  charged  less  than  $1  to  STO  an  options  position,  as  well  as  less  than  $1  to  BTC  an  options  position,  so  not  sure  about  that  minimum.  Regarding  what  I  read  as  your  overall  underlying  question  (why  are  option  fees  so  high),  in  my  research  this  broker  has  one  of  the  cheapest  commission  rates  on  options  I've  ever  seen.    When  I  participate  in  certain  discussions,  I'm  routinely  told  that  these  fees  are  unbelievable  and  that  $5.95,  $7.95,  or  even  $9.95  are  considered  low  fees.      I've  heard  this  so  much,  and  discussed  commissions  with  enough  people  who've  refused  to  switch  brokers,  that  I  conclude  there  just  isn't  enough  competition  to  drive  prices  lower.    If  most  people  won't  switch  brokers  to  go  from  $9.95  to  $1  per  trade,  there  simply  isn't  a  reason  to  lower  rates.
86040	Unrealistic  assumption,  but  I'll  play  along.  Ultimately,  dividends  would  exist  because  some  innovative  shareholder  of  some  company,  at  some  time,  would  desire  income  from  their  investment  and  could  propose  the  idea  of  sharing  the  profit.  Like-minded  investors  also  desiring  income  could  vote  for  dividends  to  come  into  existence  —  or,  rather,  vote  for  a  board  of  directors  that  supports  enactment  of  the  idea.  (In  your  fictitious  world,  shareholders  do  still  control  the  corporation,  right?)  In  this  world,  though,  dividends  wouldn't  be  called  "dividends",  a  terrible  name  that's  too  "mathy"  for  the  inhabitants  of  that  world.  Rather,  they  would  institute  a  quarterly  or  annual  shareholder  profit  share.  Governments  would  enact  legislation  to  approve  of—nay,  encourage  such  an  innovation  because  it  becomes  a  new  source  of  recurring  income  they  can  tax.  Alternatively,  even  if  the  idea  of  a  cash  dividend  didn't  occur  to  anybody  in  that  world,  investors  would  realize  the  stock  price  is  depressed  and  could  propose  and  vote  for  the  board  to  institute  share  buybacks.  The  company  repurchasing  some  portion  of  shares  periodically  would  provide  income  to  shareholders  participating  in  the  buyback.  If  the  buyback  were  oversubscribed,  they  could  structure  it  fairly  (pro-rata  participation,  etc.)  Alternatively,  shareholders  would  pressure  the  board  (or  fire  them  and  vote  in  a  new  board)  to  put  the  company  up  for  sale  and  find  a  larger  buyer,  who  would  purchase  the  shares  for  cash.  This  can't  scale  forever,  though,  so  the  pressure  will  increase  for  solutions  like  #1  and  #2.
293048	In  the  unlikely  case  that  noone  finds  a  way  to  extract  resources  from  the  company  and  distribute  them  to  shareholders  periodically  in  a  way  that's  de  facto  equivalent  to  dividends,  any  company  can  be  dissolved.  The  assets  of  the  company  would  be  sold  for  their  market  value,  the  liabilities  would  have  to  be  settled,  and  the  net  result  of  all  this  (company  cash  +  sale  results  -  liabilities)  would  be  distributed  to  shareholders  proportionally  to  their  shares.  The  'liquidation  value'  is  generally  lower  than  the  market  value  of  a  company  as  an  ongoing  concern  that's  making  business  and  earning  profit,  but  it  does  put  a  floor  on  it's  value  -  if  the  stock  price  is  too  low,  someone  can  buy  enough  stock  to  get  control  of  the  company,  vote  to  dissolve  it,  and  make  a  profit  that  way;  and  the  mere  fact  that  this  can  happen  props  up  the  stock  price.  Companies  could  even  be  created  for  a  limited  time  period  in  the  first  hand  (which  has  some  historical  precedent  with  shareholders  of  'trading  companies'  with  lifetime  of  a  single  trade  voyage).  Imagine  that  there  is  some  company  Megacorp2015  where  shareholders  want  to  receive  $1M  of  its  cash  as  "dividends".  They  can  make  appropriate  contracts  that  will  form  a  new  company  called  Megacorp2016  that  will  take  over  all  the  ongoing  business  and  assets  except  $1M  in  cash,  and  then  liquidate  Megacorp2015  and  distribute  it's  assets  (shares  of  Megacorp2016  and  the  "dividend")  among  themselves.  The  main  difference  from  normal  dividends  is  that  in  this  process,  you  need  cooperation  from  any  lenders  involved,  so  if  the  company  has  some  long-term  debts  then  they  would  need  agreement  from  those  banks  in  order  to  pay  out  "dividends".  Oh,  and  everyone  would  have  to  pay  a  bunch  more  to  lawyers  simply  to  do  "dividends"  in  this  or  some  other  convoluted  way.
16562	As  a  thought  experiment  I  suppose  we  can  ask  where  dividends  came  from  and  what  would  be  different  if  they  never  existed.  The  VOC  or  Dutch  East  India  Companywas  the  first  to  IPO,  sell  shares  and  also  have  a  dividend.      There  had  been  trade  entrepot  before  the  VOC,  the  bulk  cog  (type  of  sea-going  ship)  trade  in  the  Hanseatic  League,  but  the  VOC  innovation  was  to  pool  capital  to  build  giant  spice  freighters  -  more  expensive  than  a  merchant  partnership  could  likely  finance  (and  stand  to  lose  at  sea)  on  their  own  but  more  efficient  than  the  cogs  and  focused  on  a  trade  good  with  more  value.    The  Dutch  Republic  became  rich  by  this  capital  formed  to  pursue  high  value  trade.  Without  dividends  this  wouldn't  have  been  an  innovation  in  seventeenth  century  Europe  and  enterprises  would  be  only  as  large  as  say  the  contemporary  merchant  family  networks  of  Venice  could  finance.    So  there  could  be  large  partnerships,  family  businesses  and  debt  financed  ventures  but  no  corporations  as  such.
568944	A  share  of  stock  is  a  small  fraction  of  the  ownership  of  the  company.  If  you  expect  the  company  to  eventually  be  of  interest  to  someone  who  wants  to  engineer  a  merger  or  takeover,  it's  worth  whatever  someone  is  willing  to  pay  to  help  make  that  happen  or  keep  it  from  happening.  Which  means  it  will  almost  always  track  the  company's  value  to  some  degree,  because  the  company  itself  will  buy  back  shares  when  it  can  if  they  get  too  cheap,  to  protect  itself  from  takeover.  It  may  also  start  paying  dividends  at  a  later  date.  You  may  also  value  being  able  to  vote  on  the  company's  actions.  Including  whether  it  should  offer  a  dividend  or  reinvest  that  money  in  the  company.  Basically,  you  would  want  to  own  that  share  --  or  not  --  for  the  same  reasons  you  would  want  to  own  a  piece  of  that  business.  Because  that's  exactly  what  it  is.
521604	This  is  how  capital  shares  in  split  capital  investment  trusts  work  they  never  get  any  dividend  they  just  get  the  capital  when  the  company  is  wound  up
346166	Currently  the  credit  history  are  not  International  but  are  local.  Many  countries  don't  have  a  concept  of  credit  history  yet.      Having  said  that,  if  you  are  moving  to  US,  depending  on  your  history  in  your  country,  you  can  ask  the  same  bank  to  provide  you  with  a  card  and  then  start  building  history.  For  example  in  India  I  had  a  card  with  Citi  Bank  and  when  I  moved  to  US  for  a  short  period,  I  was  given  a  card  based  on  my  India  Card,  with  equivalent  credit  in  USD.  If  you  are  moving  often  internationally,  it  would  make  sense  to  Bank  with  a  leading  bank  that  provide  services  in  geographies  of  your  interest  [Citi,  HSBC,  etc]  and  then  in  a  new  country  approach  these  institutions  to  get  you  some  starting  credit  for  you  to  build  a  history.
184365	It's  not  just  that  credit  history  is  local;  it's  that  it's  a  private  business  run  for  profit.  The  "big  three"  credit  bureaus  in  the  US  are  Experian,  Equifax  and  Transunion.    They  collect  information  on  debt  usage  and  abuse  from  various  companies  in  the  US,  and  charge  a  fee  to  provide  that  information  (and  their  judgement  of  you)  to  companies  interested  in  offering  you  further  credit.    But  there's  nothing  stopping  a  company  from  collecting  international  credit  histories,  or  specialized  credit  histories  either  (for  instance,  there's  a  company  called  ChexSystems  which  focuses  on  retail  purchase  financing  (mostly  auto)  and  checking  account  abuse,  while  ignoring  other  types  of  lending).  That  being  said,  I  don't  know  of  any  companies  which  currently  collect  international  credit  histories.    Perhaps  in  Europe,  with  more  nations  in  close  geographic  proximity,  there  would  be,  but  not  in  North  America.
267422	Credit  history  is  local,  so  when  you  move  to  the  US  you  start  with  the  blank  slate.  Credit  history  length  is  a  huge  factor,  so  in  the  first  year  expect  that  nobody  would  trust  you  and  you  may  be  refused  credit  or  asked  for  deposits.  I  was  asked  for  deposits  at  cell  phone  company  and  refused  for  store  cards  couple  of  times.  My  advice  -  get  a  secured  credit  card  (that  means  you  put  certain  sum  of  money  as  a  deposit  in  the  bank  and  you  get  credit  equal  to  that  sum  of  money)  and  if  you  have  something  like  a  car  loan  that  helps  too  (of  course,  you  shouldn't  buy  a  car  just  for  that  ;)  but  if  you're  buying  anyway,  just  know  it's  not  only  hurting  but  also  helping  when  you  pay).  Once  you  have  a  year  or  two  of  the  history  and  you've  kept  with  all  the  payments,  you  credit  score  would  be  OK  and  everybody  would  be  happy  to  work  with  you.  In  4-5  years  you  can  have  excellent  credit  record  if  you  pay  on  time  and  don't  do  anything  bad.  If  you  are  working  it  the  US,  a  lot  of  help  at  first  would  be  to  take  a  letter  from  your  company  on  an  official  letterhead  saying  that  you  are  employed  by  this  and  that  company  and  are  getting  salary  of  this  and  that.  That  can  serve  as  an  assurance  for  some  merchants  that  otherwise  would  be  reluctant  to  work  with  you  because  of  the  absence  of  credit  history.  If  you  have  any  assets  overseas,  especially  if  they  are  held  in  a  branch  of  international  bank  in  US  dollars,  that  could  help  too.  In  general,  don't  count  too  much  on  credit  for  first  1-2  years  (though  you'd  probably  could  get  a  car  loan,  for  example,  but  rates  would  be  exorbitant  -  easily  10  percentage  points  higher  than  with  good  credit),  but  it  will  get  better  soon.
50080	Some  countries  in  European  Union  are  starting  to  implement  credit  history  sharing,  for  example  now  history  from  polish  bureau  BIK  and  German  Schufa  are  mutually  available.  Similar  agreements  are  planned  between  polish  BIK  and  bureaus  in  the  Netherlands  and  United  Kingdom.
320616	It'll  be  just  like  any  other  loan  you  make,  on  your  end,  and  receive,  on  your  LLC's  end.  You  pay  taxes  on  the  interest  received,  and  your  LLC  can  deduct  the  interest  paid.        Do  make  sure  you  set  it  up  properly,  however:    If  you  want  to  loan  money  to  your  business,  you  should  have  your      attorney  draw  up  paperwork  to  define  the  terms  of  the  loan,  including      repayment  and  consequences  for  non-repayment  of  the  loan.  It  should  be      clear  that  the  loan  is  a  binding  obligation  on  the  part  of  the      company.  As  a  recent  Tax  Court  case  notes,  the  absence  of  such      paperwork  negates  the  loan.  For  tax  purposes,  the  loan  is  an  "arms      length"  transaction,  being  treated  like  any  other  debt.      From:  http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/financingyourstartup/f/investinbusiness.htm
436119	It  looks  like  you'd  just  be  charging  yourself  interest  and  paying  yourself  back,  because  it's  a  pass-through  entity,  as  I'm  sure  you  know.    (This  assumes  you're  the  only  member  of  the  LLC.)  It  all  depends  on  how  much  money  you  want  inside  the  protective  cover  of  the  LLC,  and  for  how  long.    It  doesn't  seem  to  make  much  difference  how  you  get  the  cash  in  or  out,  or  how  complicated  or  easy  you  make  it  for  yourself.
547835	For  those  who  are  looking  to  improve  credit  for  the  sake  of  being  able  to  obtain  future  credit  on  better  terms,  I  think  a  rewards  credit  card  is  the  best  way  to  do  that.  I  recommend  that  you  only  use  as  many  cards  as  you  need  to  gain  the  best  rewards.  I  have  one  card  that  gives  6%  back  on  grocery  purchases,  and  I  have  another  card  that  gives  4%  back  on  [petrol]  and  2%  back  on  dining  out.  Both  of  those  cards  give  only  1%  back  on  all  other  purchases,  so  I  use  a  third  card  that  gives  1.5%  back  across  the  board  for  my  other  purchases.  I  pay  all  of  the  cards  in  full  each  month.  If  there  was  a  card  that  didn't  give  me  an  advantage  in  making  my  purchases,  I  wouldn't  own  it.  I'm  generally  frugal,  so  I  know  that  there  is  no  psychological  disadvantage  to  paying  with  a  card.  You  have  to  consider  your  own  spending  discipline  when  deciding  whether  paying  with  cards  is  an  advantage  for  you.  In  the  end,  you  should  only  use  debt  when  you  can  pay  low  interest  rates  (or  as  in  the  case  of  the  cards  above,  no  interest  at  all).  In  the  case  of  the  low  interest  debt,  it  should  be  allowing  you  to  make  an  investment  that  will  pay  you  more  by  having  it  sooner  than  the  cost  of  interest.  You  might  need  a  car  to  get  to  work,  but  you  probably  don't  need  a  new  car.  Borrow  as  little  as  you  can  and  repay  your  loans  as  quickly  as  you  can.  Debt  can  be  a  tool  for  your  advantage,  but  only  if  used  wisely.  Don't  be  lured  in  by  the  temptation  of  something  new  and  shiny  now  that  you  can  pay  for  later.
526477	So  you  work,  and  give  a  small  irregular  amount  to  you  parents.    You  live  with  very  low  expenses.    Assuming  you  make  a  bit  below  the  average  salary  in  the  UK,  you  should  be  able  to  save  around  £1000.    If  you  found  a  part  time  job  could  you  save  double?    I  bet  you  could.  So  why  do  you  need  credit?    Why  do  you  need  a  credit  score?  Having  poor  or  no  credit  can  be  remedied  by  having  a  large  down  payment.    Essentially  the  bank  asks,  if  this  person  could  afford  the  payment  of  this  loan  why  have  they  not  been  saving  the  money?    You  could  save  the  money  and  either  buy  the  thing(s)  you  desire  with  cash  (the  smartest),  or  put  50%  down.    Putting  50%  or  more  down  turns  you  into  a  good  credit  risk  despite  having  no  credit  history.      In  case  you  missed  it:    why  not  just  save  the  money  and  buy  it  for  cash?    Why  have  compounding  interest  working  against  you?    Why  do  you  want  to  work  for  the  bank?  Making  the  interest  payments  on  loans  in  order  to  build  a  credit  score  is  just  silly.    It  is  an  instance  of  a  "tail  wagging  the  dog".
15163	Any  kind  of  credit  contract  such  as  a  mobile  phone  contract  (could  be  SIM  only  or  with  a  handset)  would  also  help  increase  your  number  of  accounts  and  demonstrate  a  track  record  of  responsible  management  and  repayments.  If  you  have  a  Pay  As  You  Go  phone  at  present  consider  a  SIM  only  contract  with  the  same  network,  and  if  your  parents  currently  pay  for  your  phone  consider  if  it  would  be  worth  switching  it  into  your  own  name.  Also  make  sure  that  you  are  registered  on  the  Electoral  Role  at  your  permanent  address  and  have  at  least  a  minimum  payment  direct  debit  set  up  on  your  credit  card  (even  though  you  state  you  intend  to  repay  in  full)  to  make  sure  you  don't  forget  a  payment  as  this  will  disproportionately  affect  your  score  when  combined  with  young  age  and  few  other  accounts.  Lastly  ensure  that  you  have  a  decent  amount  of  "head  room"  on  your  rolling  credit  accounts  like  credit  cards  and  aren't  using  more  than  80%  of  the  credit  available  to  you  through  your  monthly  spending,  if  necessary  by  asking  for  an  increased  limit  from  your  company  (and  then  not  using  it).
513256	One  of  the  other  things  you  could  do  to  improve  your  score  would  be  along  the  lines  of  what  Pete  said  in  his  answer,  but  using  the  current  financial  climate  to  your  advantage.  I'm  not  sure  what  interest  rates  are  available  to  you  in  the  UK,  but  I  currently  have  4  lines  of  credit  aside  from  my  house.  One  is  a  credit  card  I  use  for  every  day  purchases  and  like  you  pay  off  immediately  with  every  statement.  The  other  three  are  technically  credit  cards,  however  all  three  were  used  to  make  purchases  with  0%  financing.  The  one  was  for  a  TV  I  bought  that  even  gave  me  5%  off  if  I  pay  it  off  within  6  months.  That  cash  has  been  sitting  in  my  savings  since  the  day  I  bought  it.  I'm  making  regular  payments  on  all  three,  but  not  having  to  pay  any  interest.  My  credit  score  dropped  25  points  with  the  one  as  it  was  an  elective  medical  expense  (Visian  eye  surgery),  so  for  the  time  the  balance  is  near  my  credit  limit.  However,  that  will  bounce  back  up  as  the  balance  lowers.  My  score  was  also  able  to  take  that  hit  and  still  be  very  high.  If  you  don't  have  0%  (or  very  close)  available,  your  better  bet  would  be  to  follow  the  other  suggestions  about  saving  for  a  sizable  down  payment,  or  other  every  day  expenses  like  a  cell  phone.
408763	You  can  improve  your  credit  score  simply  by  being  an  authorized  user  on  someone's  credit  card  account.    They  don't  even  physically  have  to  give  you  a  card  to  use,  they  can  just  add  you  to  the  account  as  an  authorized  user  and  your  credit  score  will  be  affected.    Be  forewarned  though,  it  can  be  negatively  impacted  as  well.    Only  participate  in  such  a  scheme  if  it's  with  someone  trustworthy  and  reliable.
409927	When  you  say  "promptly  paying  off  the  outstanding  balance",  do  you  mean  you  pay  it  off  literally  as  soon  as  you  have  incurred  the  debt?  It  is  important  to  actually  let  the  debt  post  on  a  statement  before  you  pay  it  off.  If  you  pay  it  off  before  the  statement  posts  then  this  won't  help  your  credit  at  all.  Once  the  statement  posts  you  can  pay  the  entire  balance  off  before  the  due  date  and  you  will  still  pay  no  interest.  Assuming  you  are  allowing  the  balance  to  actually  post  on  your  statements,  you  can  simply  continue  to  do  this  and  your  credit  score  will  improve  over  time  as  your  account(s)  get  older  and  you  show  that  you  are  reliable.  The  only  other  way  to  improve  your  credit  score  is  to  open  more  accounts.  In  the  short  term  this  will  actually  hurt  your  score,  as  it  will  decrease  your  average  age  of  account  and  add  an  inquiry.  However  in  the  mid-long  term,  this  will  improve  your  score  as  having  more  accounts  of  a  variety  of  types  is  better  for  your  score.  Having  an  installment  loan  such  as  an  auto  loan  or  home  loan  is  good  for  your  score  as  it  is  different  from  a  credit  card  -  however  you  should  definitely  not  engage  in  one  of  these  unless  it  makes  financial  sense  for  other  reasons.  Don't  add  debt  just  to  build  your  credit  score.  You  could  just  open  more  credit  cards.  Like  I  said  it  will  hurt  your  score  in  the  short  term  but  improve  it  in  the  mid-long  term.  Open  cards  with  a  variety  of  benefits  so  you  can  use  them  for  different  things  to  get  better  rewards.
253705	US  based  so  I  don't  know  how  closely  this  translates  to  the  UK,  but  generally  speaking  there  are  three  things  that  contribute  to  a  strong  credit  score.  Length/volume  of  credit  history.  This  is  a  combination  of  how  many  accounts  appear  in  your  history  along  with  how  long  they  have  been  open.    Having  a  series  of  accounts  that  were  maintained  in  good  standing  looks  better  than  only  having  one.    Maintaining  an  account  in  good  standing  for  a  prolonged  period  (3+  years)  is  better  than  a  bunch  of  short  term  items.    "Ideally"  your  credit  history  should  contain  a  mix  of  term  loans  that  were  paid  per  contract  and  a  few  (1?)  revolving  account  that  shows  ongoing  use.    The  goal  is  to  show  that  you  can  handle  ongoing  obligations  responsibly,  and  manage  multiple  things  at  the  same  time.  Utilization.  Or  how  much  you  currently  owe  vs  how  much  people  have  agreed  to  lend  you.    Being  close  to  your  limits  raises  questions  about  whether  or  not  you  can  really  handle  the  additional  debt.    Having  large  availability  raises  questions  about  whether  you  would  be  able  to  handle  it  if  you  suddenly  maxed  things  out.    Finding  the  correct  middle  point  can  be  challenging,  the  numbers  I  have  seen  thrown  around  most  by  the  "experts"  is  20-30%  utilization.  Recent  Activity.  Or  how  much  new  debt  have  you  taken  on?    If  someone  is  opening  lots  of  new  accounts  it  raises  red  flags.    Shopping  around  for  a  deal  on  a  auto  loan  or  mortgage  before  settling  on  one  is  fine.    Opening  5  new  credit  lines  in  the  past  6  months,  probably  going  to  knock  you  down  a  bit.    One  of  the  concerns  here  is  have  you  had  the  accounts  long  enough  to  demonstrate  that  you  will  be  able  to  handle  them  in  the  long  term.  One  route  that  was  suggested  to  me  in  my  early  years  was  to  go  take  out  a  6mo  loan  from  a  bank,  and  just  place  the  money  in  a  CD  while  I  made  the  payments.    Then  repeat  with  a  longer  term.    Worst  case,  you  can  cash  out  the  CD  to  pay  off  the  loan  in  an  emergency,  but  otherwise  it  helps  show  the  type  of  history  they  are  looking  for.  All  that  said,  I  have  to  agree  with  Pete  B's  answer.    Don't  play  the  credit  game  if  you  don't  really  need  to.    Or  play  it  just  enough  to  stay  in  the  game  and  plan  your  finances  to  avoid  relying  on  it.    (Advice  I  wish  I  had  taken  long  ago.)
15202	If  credit  scoring  works  in  the  UK  like  it  does  in  the  US,  then  I  think  the  fact  that  you  own+use  a  credit  card  and  pay  off  your  everyday  expenses  will  give  you  perfectly  good  credit.    Just  keep  doing  what  you're  doing.  I  have  seen  people  in  the  United  States  with  very  high  credit  scores  based  solely  upon  owning  &  occasionally  using  a  credit  card,  paid  in  full  and  on  time  every  month.
403934	An  activity  which  can  help  improve  your  credit  score  and  actually  make  you  money  is  stoozing.  It's  a  little  complicated  but  can  be  beneficial  to  do.  Using  either  a  credit  card  which  allows  fee  free  money  withdrawals  from  cashpoints  or  building  up  debt  using  your  credit  card  gives  you  access  to  your  credit  amount.  You  then  use  a  long  term  0%  balance  transfer  card  to  transfer  the  debt  which  you  pay  off  at  the  minimum  rate.  It's  0%  so  no  costs  are  associated  except  for  the  initial  fee  paid  for  the  balance  transfer  amount.  The  money  that  would  have  been  used  to  pay  off  the  credit  amount  (or  money  withdrawn  from  a  cashpoint)  can  then  be  deposited  in  a  savings  account  so  you  are  now  earning  interest  on  the  credit  balance.  Continuing  to  make  monthly  minimum  payments  via  direct  debit  will  help  improve  your  credit  rating  and  the  savings  money  will  earn  interest.  (it  is  also  available  if  you  suddenly  need  to  pay  off  the  0%  card)
68431	Buy  a  car.  Vehicle  loans,  like  mortgages,  are  installment  loans.  Credit  cards  are  revolving  lines  of  credit.  In  the  US,  your  credit  score  factors  in  the  different  types  of  credit  you  have.  Note  that  there  are  several  methods  for  calculating  credit  scores,  including  multiple  types  of  FICO  scores.  You  could  buy  a  car  and  drive  for  Uber  to  help  cash  flow  the  car  payments  and/or  save  for  your  next  purchase.  As  others  have  suggested,  you  should  be  very  careful  with  debt  and  ask  critical  questions  before  taking  it  on.  Swiping  a  credit  card  is  more  about  your  behavior  and  self-control  than  it  is  logic  and  math.  And  if  you  ever  want  to  start  a  business  or  make  multi-million  dollar  purchases  (e.g.  real  estate),  or  do  a  lot  of  other  things,  you'll  need  good  credit.
176836	The  best  bank  with  least  amount  of  gotchas  is  Alliant  Credit  Union.    I  did  a  lot  of  research  and  finally  decided  on  this  bank.      I  did  a  comparative  study  between  ING,  Ally  and  Alliant  and  found  Alliant  to  be  superior  than  the  the  other  two.      More  about  my  study:  http://www.moneycone.com/a-bank-thats-better-than-ally-and-ingdirect/  If  you  do  find  a  better  bank  than  this,  please  update  this  post,  I'd  definitely  like  to  know!  Disclaimer:  I  have  no  relationship  with  either  of  the  three  banks.
84263	Check  with  a  small  local  bank  or  credit  union,  they  might  offer  better  terms.  That  said,  my  local  credit  union  still  charges  $6/month  for  a  checking  account  if  you  don't  have  a  direct  deposit  into  it.
311116	Here's  a  hack  for  getting  the  "free"  checking  that  requires  direct  deposit.  Some  effort  to  set  up,  but  once  everything  is  in  place,  it's  all  autopilot.  (If  your  transfer  into  savings  is  higher  than  your  transfer  out  of  savings,  you'll  build  up  a  nice  little  stash  over  time.)  I  don't  know  if  there  are  deposit  amounts  or  frequencies  that  you  must  have  to  qualify  for  the  free  account,  if  these  are  public  or  secret,  or  if  this  works  everywhere.  If  anyone  else  has  experience  using  this  kind  of  hack,  please  leave  a  comment.
393467	If  you  want  to  deposit  checks  or  conduct  business  at  a  window,  you  should  look  at  a  local  savings  bank  or  credit  union.  Generally,  you  can  find  one  that  will  offer  "free"  checking  in  exchange  for  direct  deposit  or  a  minimum  balance.  Some  are  totally  free,  but  those  banks  pay  zippo  for  interest.  If  you  don't  care  about  location,  I  would  look  at  Charles  Schwab  Bank.  I've  been  using  them  for  a  couple  of  years  and  have  been  really  satisfied  with  them.  They  provide  free  checking,  ATM  fee  reimbursement,  free  checks  and  pre-paid  deposit  envelopes.  You  also  can  easily  move  money  between  Schwab  brokerage  or  savings  accounts.  Other  brokers  offer  similar  services  as  well.
252978	Capital  One  360.  No  minimums  balance,  no  fees.  Everything's  online.  Make  deposits  using  an  app  or  an  image  of  the  check.  ATMs  are  free  almost  everywhere.
580935	Online  banks  are  the  future.  As  long  as  you  don't  need  a  clerk  to  talk  to  (and  why  would  you  need?)  there's  nothing  you  can't  do  with  an  online  bank  that  you  can  with  a  brick  and  mortar  robbers.  I  use  E*Trade  trading  account  as  a  checking  account  (it  allows  writing  paper  checks,  debit  card  transactions,  ACH  in/out,  free  ATM,  etc).  If  you  don't  need  paper  checks  that  often  you  can  use  ING  or  something  similar.  You  can  always  go  to  a  local  credit  union,  but  those  will  wave  the  fee  in  exchange  for  direct  deposit  or  high  balance,  and  that  you  can  also  get  from  the  large  banks  as  well,  so  no  much  difference  there.  Oh  where  where  did  Washington  Mutual  go....
597053	Yes.  W4  determines  how  much  your  employer  will  withhold  from  your  wages.  Leaving  everything  at  default  would  mean  that  your  salary  is  your  only  taxable  income,  and  you  only  take  default  deductions.  Your  employee  will  calculate  your  tax  withholding  based  on  that.  But,  if  your  salary  is  >200k,  I  assume  that  you  have  other  income  (investment/capital  gains,  interest  on  your  bank  account),  which  you  will  have  to  pay  taxes  on.  You're  probably  going  to  have  some  deductible  expenses  (business/partnership  expenses,  mortgage  interest,  donations,  college  funds  etc)  as  well.  So  it  is  very  likely,  unless  you're  really  not  smart  about  money,  that  you  have  more  to  do  with  your  taxes  than  just  the  employers'  withholding.
443014	There  are  still  ways  that  the  default  values  on  the  W4  can  lead  you  to  get  a  refund  or  owe  the  IRS.  If  there  was  a  big  delta  in  your  paychecks,  it  can  lead  to  problems.  If  you  make  260,000  and  get  26  paychecks  that  means  each  check  had  a  gross  of  10,000.  Your  company  will  withhold  the  same  amount  from  each  check.  But  If  you  earned  a  big  bonus  then  the  smaller  regular  paychecks  may  not  have  been  withholding  enough.    When  bonus  checks  are  involved  the  payroll  office  has  to  treat  them  as  irregular  pay  to  be  able  to  make  it  work  out.  Some  companies  don't  do  this,  so  you  may  under  or  over  pay  during  the  year.  If  you  changed  companies  during  the  year,  this  can  lead  to  under  or  over  payment.  The  lower  paying  company  would  not  know  about  the  higher  rate  of  pay  at  the  other  company.  so  at  one  you  would  under  pay,  and  the  other  you  would  over  pay.  There  are  also  social  security  issues  with  more  than  one  employer.
118557	See  the  accepted  answer  for  this  question.    What  effect  will  credit  card  churning  for  frequent  flyer  miles  have  on  my  credit  score?  This  does  not  directly  answer  'how  often...'  that  you  asked,  but  it  states  that  the  answerer  opens  5-15  accounts  per  year.    So  the  answer  to  your  question  is,  as  often  as  you  want,  as  long  as  you  manage  your  account  ages.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  there  are  two  factors  in  opening  a  new  account  that  affect  your  credit  card  score.    One  is  average  age  of  accounts.  The  other  is  credit  inquiries.    That  answerer,  with  FICO  in  high  700s,  sees  about  a  5%  swing  based  on  new  cards  and  closing  old  ones.  You'll  have  to  manage  average  age  of  accounts.    I  assume  this  is  done  by  keeping  some  older  ones  open  to  prop  up  the  average,  and  by  judiciously  closing  the  churn  accounts.  Finally,  if  you  choose  to  engage  in  churning,  and  you  intend  to  apply  for  a  large  loan  and  want  a  good  credit  score,  simply  pause  the  account  open/close  part  of  the  churn  a  couple  of  months  ahead  of  time.    Your  score  should  recover  from  the  temporary  hits  of  the  inquiries.      The  churning  communities  really  do  have  how  to  guides  which  discuss  the  details  of  this.    Key  phrase:  credit  card  churning.
99279	An  inquiry  to  your  credit  report  is  a  slight  ding  and  lasts  2  years.  I'd  suggest  that  if  you  are  playing  the  bonus  game  you  watch  your  score  closely,  and  if  it  drops  below  the  level  you'd  like  to  maintain,  hold  off  a  while.  Credit  Karma  offers  a  good  simulation  to  show  the  impact  of  inquiries,  utilization,  new  accounts,  etc.
116243	Your  credit  score  is  definitely  affected  by  the  age  of  your  credit  accounts,  so  if  you  frequently  close  one  card  and  open  another  new  one,  you're  adversely  affecting  the  overall  average  age  of  accounts.    This  is  something  to  consider  and  whether  it  is  worth  what  you're  trying  to  achieve.  Sometimes,  if  you're  a  good  customer  and  are  insistent  enough,  you  can  simply  call  your  credit  card  company  and  use  the  threat  of  closing  your  account  in  favor  of  another  card  that  offers  something  attractive  to  get  your  current  bank  to  sweeten  its  incentives  to  keep  your  business.    I  know  many  people  who've  done  this  with  real  success,  and  they  spare  themselves  the  hassle  of  obtaining  a  new  card  and  suffering  the  short  term  consequences  on  their  credit  report.    This  might  be  an  avenue  worth  trying  before  you  just  close  the  account  and  move  on.  I  hope  this  helps.  Good  luck!
375606	When  over  the  long  term  housing  costs  in  a  area  rise  faster  than  wages  rise,  the  demographic  of  who  lives  in  the  area  changes.  The  size  and  income  parameters  change.  A  region  that  was  full  of  young  singles  is  now  populated  with  couples  with  adult  children,  that  means  that  the  businesses  and  amenities  have  to  change.  At  a  national  level  it  isn't  sustainable  unless  other  items  change.  The  portion  of  monthly  income  that  can  be  safely  allocated  to  housing  would  have  to  change.  One  adjustment  could  be  the  the  lengthening  of  home  loan  periods,  thus  dropping  the  monthly  payment.    This  has  been  seen  with  car  loans,  over  the  last  few  decades  the  length  of  loans  has  increased.  In  interesting  related  event  could  be  the  change  in  deduction  of  mortgage  interest  and  property  tax.  If  this  was  to  change  abruptly,  there  could  be  an  abrupt  change  the  estimated  value  of  housing,  because  the  calculus  of  affordability  would  change.
517305	In  a  strictly  mathematical  sense,  no.  Or  rather,  it  depends  what  'long  run'  means.    Say  today  the  home  average  is  $200K,  and  payment  is  $900/mo.  The  $900  today  happens  to  be  about  20%  of  the  median  US  monthly  income  (which  is  approximately  $54,000/yr).  Housing  rises  4%/yr,  income  3%/yr.  In  100  years  (long  enough?)  the  house  costs  $10M  but  incomes  are  'only'  $1.03M/yr,  and  the  mortgage,  even  at  the  same  rate  is  $45K/month,  or,  to  be  clear,  it  rose  to  52%  of  monthly  income.    My  observation  is  that,  long  term,  the  median  home  costs  what  25%  of  median  income  will  support,  in  terms  of  the  mortgage  after  downpayment.  Long  term.  That  means  that  if  you  graph  this,  you'll  see  trends  above  and  below  the  long  term  line.  You'll  see  a  25  year  bubble  form  starting  in  the  late  80's  as  rates  dropped  from  near  18%  to  the  Sub-4%  in  the  early  00s.  But  once  you  normalize  it  to  percent  of  income  to  pay  the  loan,  much  of  the  bubble  is  flattened  out.  At  18%,  $1500/mo  bought  you  a  $100K  mortgage,  but  at  3.5%,  it  bought  $335K.  This  is  in  absolute  dollars,  wages  also  rose  during  that  time.  I  am  just  clarifying  how  rates  distort  the  long  term  trends  and  create  the  short  term  anomalies.
87706	I  wouldn't  try  to  tell  him  what  he  should  do,  nor  would  I  provide  any  financial  assistance.  Invite  him  over  and  tell  him  how  a  Dave  Ramsey  book  changed  your  life  or  something  so  that  you  aren't  the  one  telling  him  what  to  do.  People  in  fundamentally  and  persistently  bad  situations  are  like  people  with  addiction  problems...  they  tend  to  end  up  "killing  the  messenger"  before  internalizing  that  they  are  in  a  bad  situation.  They  need  to  hit  rock  bottom  before  you  can  really  help.
435848	Talk  about  opportunity  cost.  Show  a  rope,  and  put  a  tag  with  him  on  the  end  of  it.    Explain  that  since  he  has  max  out  his  credit,  he  can  no  longer  get  more.    Without  more  credit  here  are  the  things  he  can't  have  The  key  to  illustrate  is  that  all  the  money  he  makes,  for  the  next  several  years  is  obligated  to  the  people  he  has  already  borrowed  it  from.    Try  to  have  him  imagine  giving  his  entire  paycheck  to  a  bank,  and  then  doing  that  for  the  next  five  years.    To  drive  it  home,  point  out  that  there  are  5  super  bowls,  5  college  championship  games,  5  final  fours,  5  annual  concerts  he  likes,  5  model  years  of  cars,  5  or  more  iPhone  versions  in  those  five  years.    Or  whatever  he  is  into.    5  years  of  laptops,  5  years  of  fishing  trips.  These  things  are  not  affordable  to  him  right  now.    He  has  already  spent  his  money  for  the  next  5  years,  and  those  are  the  things  he  cannot  have  because  he  is,  in  fact,  out  of  cash.  Furthermore,  if  he  continues,  the  credit  will  dry  up  completely  and  his  5  year  horizon  could  easily  become  ten.  To  illustrate  how  long  5  or  10  years  is,  have  him  remember  that  10  years  ago  he  might  have  been  in  college  or  the  military.    That  5  years  ago  Facebook  was  no  big  thing.    That  5  years  ago  the  Razr  was  an  awesome  phone.    That  5  years  ago  we  had  a  different  president.
178668	The  key  idea  he  should  focus  on  is  that  every  debt  includes  interest  -  the  money  he  didn't  borrow,  but  now  owes.  The  interest  goes  straight  to  the  lender  pocket  and  the  debtor  has  to  get  money  somewhere  for  that  interest.  That's  the  key  reason  of  why  getting  another  loan  only  increases  pressure  on  the  debtor  -  with  the  new  loan  he  owes  new  interest  in  addition  to  what  he  already  owed.
541729	Two  suggestions:  I  don't  know  if  you  have  them  in  South  Africa,  but  here  we  have  some  TV  reality  shows  where  a  credit  consultant  visits  a  family  that  is  deeply  in  debt  and  advises  them  on  how  to  get  out  of  it.  The  advice  isn't  very  sophisticated,  but  it  does  show  the  personal  impact  on  a  family  and  what  is  likely  to  happen  to  them  in  the  future.  "All  Maxed  Out"  is  the  name  of  the  one  I  remember.  "Till  Debt  Us  Do  Part"  is  another,  which  focusses  on  married  couples  and  the  stress  debt  puts  on  a  marriage.  If  you  can  find  a  similar  one,  loan  him  a  few  episodes.  Alternatively,  how  about  getting  him  to  a  professional  debt  counsellor?
294451	If  you're  looking  for  an  analogy  or  exercise,  I  saw  a  personal  finance  show  that  had  people  climb  stairs,  with  the  debt  as  weight.  Every  flight  of  stairs  more  "interest"  and  loans  to  cover  income  gaps  have  to  be  added  to  the  total  debt  they  carry  up  the  stairs.  Can't  find  the  video  online  though.  But  I  think  you  need  to  ask  your  brother  what  he  thinks  his  problem  is,  that  will  be  solved  with  more  loans.  It's  likely  that  your  brother's  problem  can't  be  solved  with  advice.  Since  he's  not  spending  rationally,  rational  arguments  have  no  sway.  I  suspect  he'll  tell  you  his  problem  is  one  or  two  angry  creditors,  perhaps  even  ones  you  don't  know  about,  rather  than  a  fundamental  imbalance  between  income  and  expenses.  Robbing  Peter  to  pay  Paul,  or  moving  weights  from  one  backpack  compartment  to  another,  doesn't  solve  the  underlying  problems.  Whatever  you  do,  another  loan  from  you  should  be  off  the  table.  He's  an  adult  now,  with  problems  the  size  of  which  you  can't  help  with.  We  both  know  how  his  story  ends:  all  creditors  cut  him  off,  and  he's  in  court  over  garnished  wages  and  creditors  fighting  over  his  assets.  Reality  is  the  only  argument  that  will  have  any  sway.  He's  far  too  personally  invested  in  his  scheme  to  admit  defeat,  which  is  why  neither  words  not  images  nor  moving  pictures  will  help  him  with  this  learning  disability.
279912	How  about  doing  some  calculations  and  show  him  how  much  he  is  paying  for  things  he  is  buying  on  credit.Mix  in  some  big  and  small  purchases  to  show  how  silly  it  is  on  both.  Some  examples:  What  really  made  the  debt  issue  hit  home  for  me  (no  pun  intended)  was  when  I  bought  my  first  house  and  read  the  truth  in  lending  disclosure  statements  to  find  that  a  $70K  house  (those  were  the  days)  was  going  to  cost  me  over  $200K  by  the  time  I  had  paid  off  a  30  year  note.
485488	I'm  not  good  at  persuasion,  and  I'm  not  an  expert  at  any  of  this,  but  here's  what  I've  been  thinking.  Rather  than  telling  him  that  he  shouldn't  rack  up  more  debt,  I'd  ask  him  whether  he's  planning  for  his  debt  levels  to  increase,  remain  static,  or  decrease  over  the  next  five  years.  Try  to  make  it  feel  like  he's  the  one  reaching  the  conclusion  that  he  should  be  decreasing  his  debt  load.  If  he  says  that  he's  fine  with  his  debt  levels  remaining  static  or  increasing,  then  I  don't  have  any  further  advice.  If  he  says  he's  trying  to  decrease  his  debt  level,  but  it's  actually  increasing,  then  maybe  he's  in  denial.
139026	The  only  thing  that  comes  to  mind  is  a  recent  HBO  Real  Sports  segment  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDjkbgrgcmo)  on  a  couple  of  NFL  players  who  blew  all  of  their  money.    Seeing  how  they've  ended  up  might  make  the  right  impression,  but  given  that  your  brother  ran  up  $148K  in  debt,  I'm  not  optimistic.
468777	This  is  not  the  case  with  your  brother  only.  There  are  many  business  which  run  on  this  premise.  It  goes  till  the  time  all  the  conditions  are  in  control  and  get  busted  when  things  goes  out  of  way.    You  have  mentioned  the  loan  amount  and  not  the  monthly  repayment  amount.  Even  if  you  say,  a  new  loan  will  not  solve  his  problem,  what  are  the  way  out  ?  Telling  things  nicely  sometime  does  not  work  especially  when  facts  are  otherwise.  Hence  you  need  to  make  a  compete  case  study  which  should  also  consider  his  capacity  to  pay.  As  of  now  it  seems  he  has  debts  of  around  20  months  of  his  earning,  which  can  be  considered  high,  depending  upon  the  terms  of  major  loan  such  as  car  loan  and  personal  loan.  A  case  study  is  way  out.  You  can  explain  him  with  such  case  study  that  he  should  not  go  for  further  loans.
446356	I'm  not  sure  how  much  living  expenses  are  there  but  half  of  $12,600  in  the  US  would  be  a  decent  monthly  income.      I  agree  that  debt  on  debt  would  just  add  to  his  problems,  sort  of  like  quicksand,  the  interest  will  just  makes  a  person  sink  deeper  and  deeper.    It  seems  like  it  might  take  some  more  radical  options  here  to  pay  off  the  debt.  Like,  could  he  move  into  a  much  smaller  home  or  get  a  roommate?  How  expensive  was  that  vehicle?  Could  he  sell  it  and  pay  cash  for  a  much  cheaper  used  one  and  use  the  difference  toward  his  debt?  How  much  does  he  work?  Could  he  get  a  second  job  for  just  a  few  hours  to  help  make  extra  money?  Is  he  willing  to  speak  with  a  debt  counselor?
204176	A  Certified  Financial  Planner  has  passed  a  licensing  exam  and  will  advise  you  and  help  you  reach  your  financial  goals.  A  good  CFP  can  help  you  a  lot,  especially  if  you  are  unsure  how  to  set  up  your  insurance,  investment,  savings,  and  financial  plans  on  your  own.  You  do  not  need  a  CFP  to  get  a  life  insurance  policy.  If  you  do  get  a  CFP,  he  or  she  should  help  you  above  and  beyond  life  insurance  --  i.e.  retirement  planning,  investment  advice,  education  planning,  etc.  It's  advantageous  to  you  to  pay  a  fixed  price  for  services  instead  of  a  percentage  or  commission.  Negotiate  fees  up  front.  For  life  insurance,  in  most  cases  a  term  policy  will  fit  your  needs.  Whole  life,  universal  life,  etc.,  combine  investments  and  life  insurance  into  a  single  product  and  are  big  commission  makers  for  the  salesman.  They  make  it  sound  like  the  best  thing  ever,  so  be  aware.  One  of  my  rules  of  thumb  is  that,  generally  speaking,  the  larger  the  commission  is  for  the  salesperson,  the  worse  the  product  is  for  the  consumer.  Welcome  to  life  insurance  pitches.  Term  life  is  far  less  expensive  and  provides  a  death  benefit  and  nothing  else.  If  you  just  had  a  baby  and  need  to  protect  your  family,  for  example,  term  life  is  often  a  good  solution,  easy  to  buy,  and  inexpensive.  As  you  stated,  any  of  the  major  providers  will  do  just  fine.
200468	CFP  stands  for  "Certified  Financial  Planner",  and  is  a  certification  administered  by  the  CFP  board  (a  non-government  non-profit  entity).  This  has  nothing  to  do  with  insurance,  and  CFP  are  not  insurance  agents.  Many  States  require  insurance  agents  to  be  explicitly  licensed  by  the  State  as  such,  and  only  licensed  insurance  agents  can  advise  on  insurance  products.  When  you're  looking  for  an  insurance  policy  as  an  investment  vehicle,  a  financial  adviser  (CFP,  or  whatever  else  acronym  on  the  business  card  -  doesn't  matter)  may  be  helpful.  But  in  any  case,  when  dealing  with  insurance  -  talk  to  a  licensed  insurance  agent.  If  your  financial  adviser  is  not  a  licensed  tax  adviser  (EA/CPA  licensed  in  your  State)  -  talk  to  a  licensed  tax  adviser  about  your  options  before  making  any  decisions.
498649	Well,  first  off,  if  your  children  are  NZ  citizens,  they  can  borrow  money  at  0%  interest  for  tertiary  education  and  I  don't  see  any  benefit  to  not  taking  free  money.  A  saving  account  is  your  money,  and  will  accrue  a  little  bit  of  interest  and  you  will  pay  tax  on  that.  A  family  trust  (I  hope  this  is  what  you  mean  by  trust  fund)  is  a  separate  financial  entity  that  can  be  set  up  to  own  assets  for  the  benefit  of  multiple  people.  For  example,  if  you  have  a  rental  property  or  business  and  you  want  the  income  divided  between  your  children,  rather  than  coming  to  you,  or  if  you  have  a  bach  you  want  to  keep  in  the  family  after  you  die.
405115	Of  course,  you've  already  realized  that  some  of  that  is  that  smaller  estates  are  more  common  than  larger  estates.    But  it  seems  unlikely  that  there  are  four  times  as  many  estates  between  $10  and  $11  million  as  above  that  range.      People  who  expect  to  die  with  an  estate  subject  to  inheritance  tax  tend  to  prepare.      I  don't  know  how  common  it  is,  but  if  the  surviving  member  of  a  couple  remarries,  then  the  new  spouse  gets  a  separate  exemption.    And  of  course  spouses  inherit  from  spouses  without  tax.    In  theory  this  could  last  indefinitely.    In  practice,  it  is  less  likely.    But  if  a  married  couple  has  $20  million,  the  first  spouse  could  leave  $15  million  to  the  second  and  $5  million  to  other  heirs.    The  second  spouse  could  leave  $10  million  to  a  third  spouse  (after  remarrying)  and  another  $5  million  to  children  with  the  first  spouse.    All  without  triggering  the  estate  tax.      People  can  put  some  of  their  estate  into  a  trust.    This  can  allow  the  heirs  to  continue  to  control  the  money  while  not  paying  inheritance  tax.    Supposedly  Ford  (of  Ford  Motor  Company)  took  that  route.      Another  common  strategy  is  to  give  the  maximum  without  gift  tax  each  year.    That's  at  least  $14k  per  donor  and  recipient  per  year.    So  a  married  couple  with  two  kids  can  transfer  $56k  per  year.    Plus  $56k  for  the  kids'  spouses.    And  if  there  are  four  grandchildren,  that's  another  $112k.    Great-grandchildren  count  too.    That's  more  than  a  million  every  five  years.    So  given  ten  years  to  prepare,  parents  can  transfer  $2  million  out  of  the  estate  and  to  the  heirs  without  tax.      Consider  the  case  of  two  wealthy  siblings.    They've  each  maxed  out  their  gifts  to  their  own  heirs.    So  they  agree  to  max  out  their  gifts  to  their  sibling's  heirs.    This  effectively  doubles  the  transfer  amount  without  tax  implication.      Also  realize  that  they  can  pretransfer  assets  at  the  current  market  rate.    So  if  a  rich  person  has  an  asset  that  is  currently  undervalued,  it  may  make  sense  to  transfer  it  immediately  as  a  gift.    This  will  use  up  some  of  the  estate  exemption.    But  if  you're  going  to  transfer  the  asset  eventually,  you  might  as  well  do  so  when  the  value  is  optimal  for  your  purpose.      These  are  just  the  easy  things  to  do.    If  someone  wants,  they  can  do  more  complicated  things  that  make  it  harder  for  the  IRS  to  track  value.      For  example,  the  Bezos  family  invested  in  Amazon.com  when  Jeff  Bezos  was  starting  it.    As  a  result,  his  company  could  survive  capital  losses  that  another  company  might  not.    The  effect  of  this  was  to  make  him  fabulously  rich  and  his  parents  richer  than  they  were.    But  he  won't  pay  inheritance  tax  until  his  parents  actually  transfer  the  estate  to  him  (and  I  believe  they  actually  put  it  in  a  charitable  trust).    If  his  company  had  failed  instead,  he  still  would  have  been  supported  by  the  capital  provided  by  his  parents  while  it  was  open  (e.g.  his  salary).    But  he  wouldn't  have  paid  inheritance  tax  on  it.      There  are  other  examples  of  the  same  pattern:    Fred  Smith  of  FedEx;  Donald  Trump;  Bill  Gates  of  Microsoft;  etc.    The  prime  value  of  the  estate  was  not  in  its  transfer,  but  in  working  together  while  alive  or  through  a  family  trust.    The  child's  company  became  much  more  valuable  as  a  result  of  a  parent's  wealth.    And  in  two  of  those  examples,  the  child  was  so  successful  that  the  parent  became  richer  as  a  result.    So  the  parent's  estate  does  count.    Meanwhile,  another  company  might  fail,  leaving  the  estate  below  the  threshold  despite  a  great  deal  of  parental  support.      And  those  aren't  even  fiddles.    Those  children  started  real  companies  and  offered  their  parents  real  investment  opportunities.    A  family  that  wants  to  do  so  can  do  a  lot  more  with  arrangements.    Of  course,  the  IRS  may  be  looking  for  some  of  them.      The  point  being  that  the  estate  might  be  more  than  $11  million  earlier,  but  the  parents  can  find  ways  to  reduce  it  below  the  inheritance  tax  exemption  by  the  time  that  they  die.
68632	There  are  two  main  reasons  for  the  difference  between  these  two  numbers:  While  there  are  a  few  people  that  are  wildly  wealthy,  most  of  the  people  with  more  than  10  million  have  between  10-50  million  dollars.    These  people  shield  most  of  their  estate  and  in  the  end  the  tax  only  effects  a  small  portion  of  even  the  wealthy.
418328	There  are  two  key  reasons:  Consider  a  family  of  four,  two  kids  and  two  adults,  that  has  a  net  worth  of  $20  million.  Each  of  these  four  people  live  in  a  top  1%  household.  But  any  of  those  four  people  can  die,  and  their  estate  will  not  pay  any  estate  tax.  Both  kids  and  one  spouse  can  die,  and  still  no  estate  tax  will  be  paid.  Only  when  the  last  spouse  dies  would  there  be  any  estate  tax.  Also,  consider  a  person  who  dies  but  whose  assets  do  not  flow  into  their  estate.  For  example,  their  assets  could  be  held  in  an  inter-vivos  trust.  People  with  higher  net  worths  are  much  more  likely  to  use  trusts  to  avoid  or  minimize  estate  taxes.
336277	Data  is  a  funny  thing.  There  are  many  different  ways  of  constructing  data  sets.  Keep  in  mind,  the  cite  you  linked  is  fine,  I  follow  this  kind  of  site  when  I  am  data  mining.  They  got  their  data  from  the  Government,  and  there's  no  reason  to  doubt  its  validity.  Keep  in  mind,  it's  a  survey.  They  extrapolate  from  a  survey  of  a  small  population  -  In  the  2016  survey,  6,254  families  were  interviewed,  and  in  the  2013      survey,  6,026  were  interviewed.  1)  Let's  set  that  aside,  and  look  at  the  numbers  as  if  they  were  gospel.  $10.37M  net  worth  to  be  top  1%.  That's  people  at  all  different  ages,  and  not  the  wealth  cutoff  for  those  dying,  else  the  estate  tax  would  hit  closer  to  the  1%.  Given  the  limited  data  set,  I'd  only  hypothesize,  if  we  graphed  the  age  (along  the  bottom,  X  axis)  vs  number  of  people,  the  curve  would  peek  in  mid  to  late  60's,  as  people  retire.  With  20  years  for  the  couple  to  spend  and  gift,  it's  not  tough  to  imagine  that  by  the  time  they  pass  away,  the  taxable  estate  $11M  couple  falls  to  just  .2%.    2)  When  the  estate  tax  impacted  estates  over  just  $600K,  and  my  daughter  was  born,  we  set  up  a  trust.  Out  net  worth  was  barely  positive,  but  insurance  alone  would  have  created  enough  wealth  to  have  our  orphaned  child  be  subject  to  the  tax  of  our  estate  before  she  received  a  dime.  We  also  used  the  trust  to  fund  her  college.  As  a  completed  gift,  had  we  made  some  bad  decisions  and  lost  it  all,  at  least  that  money  would  be  protected.  Keep  in  mind,  there  are  different  flavors  of  trusts,  but  it's  safe  to  say  that  in  a  survey  to  collect  data,  the  million  dollar+  trusts  are  considered  family  wealth.  Not  tough  to  imagine  a  good  fraction  of  those  families  over  $10M  have  a  nice  chunk  already  protected  this  way.    3)  Last  -  For  any  illiquid  assets,  there's  a  discount  that  gets  applied,  typically  30%.  I  own  a  ranch,  and  want  to  start  gifting  it  to  the  kids,  the  process  involves  creating  stock,  with  restrictions,  as  a  way  to  transfer  the  fractions  required  to  gift  the  $14K/yr  per  person  combination.  (That  is,  a  couple  can  gift  14x4  =  $56K  to  a  child  with  a  spouse.  4  kids,  all  married,  and  the  gifting  is  $224K/yr,  $320K  at  full  valuation.  Again,  these  gifts  may  be  to  irrevocable  trusts,  and  still  thought  of  as  their  wealth.
205719	First,  yes,  your  LLC  has  to  file  annual  taxes  to  the  US  government.    All  US  companies  do,  regardless  of  where  their  owners  live.    Second,  you  will  also  probably  be  liable  to  personally  file  a  return  in  the  US  and  unless  the  US  has  a  tax  treaty  with  India  (which  I  don't  believe  it  does)  you  may  end  up  paying  taxes  on  your  same  income  to  both  countries.    Finally,  opening  a  US  bank  account  as  a  foreign  citizen  can  be  very  tricky.  You  need  to  talk  to  a  US  accountant  who  is  familiar  with  Indian  &  US  laws.
328341	An  LLC  does  not  pay  taxes  on  profits.  As  regards  tax  a  LLC  is  treated  as  a  Partnership,  but  instead  of  partners  they  are  called  members.  The  LLC  is  a  passthrough  entity.  As  in  Partnerships  members  can  have  a  different  percentage  ownership  to  the  share  of  profits.  The  LLC  reports  the  share  of  the  profits  of  the  members.  Then  the  members  pay  the  tax  as  an  individual.  The  profit  of  the  LLC  is  deemed  to  have  been  transferred  to  the  members  regardless  of  any  funds  transferred.  This  is  often  the  case  as  the  LLC  may  need  to  retain  the  profits  for  use  in  the  business.  Late  paying  customers  may  mean  there  is  less  cash  in  the  LLC  than  is  available  to  distribute.    The  first  answer  is  wrong,  only  a  C  corporation  files  a  tax  return.  All  other  corporate  structures  are  passthrough  entities.  The  C  corporation  pays  corporation  tax  and  is  not  required  to  pass  any  funds  to  the  shareholders.  If  the  C  corporation  passes  funds  to  the  shareholders  this  is  a  dividend,  and  taxable  to  the  shareholder,  hence  double  taxation.
197501	There  is  no  such  thing  as  double  taxation.  If  you  pay  tax  in  the  US,  you  CAN  claim  tax  credits  from  India  tax  authority.    For  example,  if  you  pay  100  tax  in  USA  and  your  tax  liability  in  India  is  200,  then  you  will  only  pay  100  (200  India  tax  liability  minus  100  tax  credits  on  foreign  tax  paid  in  the  USA).    This  is  always  true  and  not  depending  on  any  treaty.  If  there  is  a  treaty,  the  tax  rate  in  the  United  States  is  set  on  the  treaty  and  you  CAN  claim  that  final  tax  rate  based  upon  that  treaty.    If  you  operate  an  LLC,  and  the  income  is  NOT  derived  from  United  States  and  you  have  no  ties  with  the  US  and  that  LLC  is  register  to  a  foreign  person  (not  company  but  a  real  human)  then  you  will  not  have  to  submit  tax  return  in  the  US...  I  advice  you  to  read  this:  http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98277,00.html
248393	ISOs  (incentive  stock  options)  can  be  closed  out  in  a  cashless  transaction.  Say  the  first  round  vests,  25,000  shares.  The  stock  is  worth  $7  but  your  option  is  to  buy  at  $5  as  you  say.  The  broker  executes  and  sells,  you  get  $50,000,  with  no  up  front  money.    Edit  based  on  comment  below  -  you  know  they  vest  over  4  years,  but  how  long  before  they  expire?  It  stands  to  reason  the  longer  you  are  able  to  hold  them,  the  better  a  chance  the  company  succeeds,  and  the  price  rises.    The  article  Understanding  employer-granted  stock  options  (PDF)  offers  a  nice  discussion  of  different  scenarios  supporting  my  answer.
558233	I've  been  offered  a  package  that  includes  100k  stock  options  at  5  dollars  a  share.  They  vest  over  4  years  at  25%  a  year.  Does  this  mean  that  at  the  end  of  the  first  year,  I'm  supposed  to  pay  for  25,000  shares?  Wouldn't  this  cost  me  125,000  dollars?  I  don't  have  this  kind  of  money.  At  the  end  of  the  first  year,  you  will  generally  have  the  option  to  pay  for  the  shares.  Yes,  this  means  you  have  to  use  your  own  money.  You  generally  dont  have  to  buy  ANY  until  the  whole  option  vests,  after  4  years  in  your  case,  at  which  point  you  either  buy,  or  you  are  considered  'vested'  (you  have  equity  in  the  company  without  buying)  or  the  option  expires  worthless,  with  you  losing  your  window  to  buy  into  the  company.  This  gives  you  plenty  of  opportunity  to  evaluate  the  company's  growth  prospects  and  viability  over  this  time.  Regarding  options  expiration  the  contract  can  have  an  arbitrarily  long  expiration  date,  like  17  years.  You  not  having  the  money  or  not  isn't  a  consideration  in  this  matter.  Negotiate  a  higher  salary  instead.  I've  told  several  companies  that  I  don't  want  their  equity  despite  my  interest  in  their  business  model  and  product.  YMMV.      Also,  options  can  come  with  tax  consequences,  or  none  at  all.  its  not  a  raw  deal  but  you  need  to  be  able  to  look  at  it  objectively.
178497	Stock  options  represent  an  option  to  buy  a  share  at  a  given  price.    What  you  have  been  offered  is  the  option  to  buy  the  company  share  at  a  given  price  ($5)  starting  a  given  date  (your  golden  handcuffs  aka  vesting  schedule).  If  the  company's  value  doubles  in  1  year  and  the  shares  are  liquid  (i.e.  you  can  sell  them)  then  you've  just  made  $125k  of  profit.    If  the  company's  value  has  gone  to  zero  in  1  year  then  you've  lost  nothing  other  than  your  hopes  of  getting  rich.  As  others  have  mentioned,  the  mechanics  of  exercising  the  option  and  selling  the  shares  can  typically  be  accomplished  without  any  cash  involved.    The  broker  will  do  both  in  a  single  transaction  and  use  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  to  pay  the  cost  of  buying  the  shares.    You  should  always  at  least  cover  the  taxable  portion  of  the  transaction  and  typically  the  broker  will  withhold  that  tax  anyways.    Otherwise  you  could  find  yourself  in  a  position  where  you  have  actually  lost  money  due  to  tax  being  owed  while  the  shares  decline  in  value  below  that  tax.    You  don't  have  to  worry  about  that  right  now.  Again  as  people  have  mentioned  options  will  typically  expire  10  years  from  vesting  or  90  days  from  leaving  your  employment  with  the  company.    I'm  sure  there  are  some  variations  on  the  theme.    Make  sure  you  ask  and  all  this  should  be  part  of  some  written  contract.    I'm  sure  you  can  ask  to  see  it  if  you  wish.    Also  typical  is  that  stock  option  grants  have  to  be  approved  by  the  board  which  is  normally  a  technicality.  Some  general  advice:
362874	the  short  answer  is:  No.  you  do  not  HAVE  to  pay  $125,000.00  at  the  end  of  your  first  year.  that  is  only  the  amount  IF  you  decide  to  exercise.    *fine  print:  But  if  you  leave  or  get  let  go  (which  happens  quite  frequently  at  top  tier  Silicon  Valley  firms),  you  lose  anything  that  you  don't  exercise.  you're  basically  chained  by  a  pair  of  golden  handcuffs.  in  other  words,  you're  stuck  with  the  company  until  a  liquidation  event  such  as  IPO  or  secondary  market  selling  (you  can  expect  to  spend  a  few  years  before  getting  anything  out  of  your  stocks)  Now,  it's  hard  to  say  whether  or  not  to  exercise  at  that  time,  especially  given  we  don't  know  the  details  of  the  company.  you  only  should  exercise  if  you  foresee  your  quitting,  anticipate  getting  fired,  AND  you  strongly  feel  that  stock  price  will  keep  going  up.  if  you're  in  SF  bay,  i  believe  you  have  10  years  until  your  options  expire  (at  which  point  they  are  gone  forever,  but  that's  10  years  and  usually  companies  IPO  well  within  7  years).  i  would  recommend  you  get  a  very  good  tax  advisor  (someone  that  understands  AMT  and  stock  options  tax  loopholes/rules  like  the  back  of  their  hand).    I'm  going  to  take  a  long  shot  and  assume  that  you  got  an  amazing  offer  and  that  you  got  a  massive  amount  of  ISOs  from  them.  so  i'll  give  this  as  an  advice  -  first,  congrats  on  owning  a  lot  on  paper  today  if  you're  still  there.  you  chose  to  be  an  early  employee  at  a  good  tech  company.  However,  you  should  be  more  worried  about  AMT  (alternative  min  tax).  you  will  get  enslaved  by  the  IRS  if  you  exercise  your  shares  and  can't  pay  the  AMT.  suppose,  in  your  fictional  scenario,  your  stock  options  increase  2x,  on  paper.  you  now  own  $1  Mil  in  options.  but  you  would  be  paying  $280000  in  taxes  if  you  chose  to  exercise  them  right  now.  Now,  unless  you  can  sell  that  IMMEDIATELY  on  the  secondary  market,  i  would  highly  advise  you  not  to  exercise  right  now.  only  exercise  your  ISOs  when  you  can  turn  around  and  sell  them  (either  waiting  for  IPO,  or  if  company  offers  secondary  market  approved  trading).
488258	A  Lease  is  an  entirely  different  way  of  getting  a  car.  In  two  situations  it  makes  sense,  in  all  other  scenarios  it  generally  doesn't  make  sense  to  lease.  In  the  case  of  always  wanting  a  new  car  every  2  or  3  years  it  can  make  sense  to  lease.  Of  course  if  you  drive  more  the  allowed  miles  you  will  pay  extra  at  the  end  of  the  lease.  If  you  can  take  the  monthly  lease  as  a  business  expense  leasing  makes  sense.  Otherwise  you  want  to  pay  cash,  or  get  financing.  Does  zero  percent  make  sense?  Sometimes.  The  only  way  to  make  sense  of  the  numbers  is  to  start  with  your  bank,  have  them  approve  of  the  loan  first.  Then  armed  with  the  maximum  loan  amount  they  will  give  you  and  the  rate  and  the  length  of  the  loan,  then  visit  the  dealer.  You  have  to  run  the  numbers  for  your  situation.  It  depends  on  your  income,  your  other  expenses,  your  credit  score,  your  bank,  what  deal  the  dealership  is  running,  how  much  you  have  for  a  down  payment.  Here  is  an  example.  For  a  recent  loan  situation  I  saw:  36  months,  1.49%  rate,  20K  loan,  total  interest  paid:  ~$466.  Armed  with  that  information  can  the  person  get  a  better  deal  at  the  dealership?  There  was  only  one  way  to  find  out.  In  that  case  the  credit  union  was  better.  The  rebate  was  larger  than  the  interest  paid.
305226	Assume  they  do  not  overwithhold.  You  pay  in  $500/mo,  and  every  time  it  hits  $3000,  they  pay  the  tax.  Engineers  call  this  a  sawtooth  function,  it  looks  like  this.    The  average  balance  is  not  $3000,  but  close  to  $1500.  The  very  simple  math  is  $1500  *  rate  *  years.    It  looks  like  your  equation  except  it's  not  58,  it's  just  the  years.  And  the  question  is  whether  you  can  make  more  than  $850  on  $1500  average  before  you  sell.  I  wouldn't  be  so  quick  to  plug  in  29  years,  as  the  average  home  ownership  is  7  years,  and  depending,  who  knows  if  a  refinance  is  in  your  future?    The  bottom  line  -  How  long  would  it  take  you  to  get  a  57%  return  (2350/1500)?  Ironically,  the  most  responsible  (and  risk  averse)  person  would  say  "decades.  Banks  offer  less  than  1%."  even  an  8%  market  return,  while  not  guaranteed,  is  close  to  7  years.  But,  if  you  carry  18%  credit  card  debt,  you  can  pay  it  down  a  bit  each  month  and  let  it  float  back  up  every  6  months.  Less  than  4  years  to  break  even.
444390	Consider  that  the  bank  of  course  makes  money  on  the  money  in  your  escrow.  It  is  nothing  but  a  free  loan  you  give  the  bank,  and  the  official  reasons  why  they  want  it  are  mostly  BS  -  they  want  your  free  loan,  nothing  else.  As  a  consequence,  to  let  you  out  of  it,  they  want  the  money  they  now  cannot  make  on  your  money  upfront,  in  form  of  a  'fee'.  That  explains  the  amount;  it  is  right  their  expected  loss  by  letting  you  out.  Unfortunately,  knowing  this  doesn't  change  your  options.  Either  way,  you  will  have  to  pay  that  money;  either  as  a  one-time  fee,  or  as  a  continuing  loss  of  interest.  As  others  mentioned,  you  cannot  calculate  with  29  years,  as  chances  are  the  mortgage  will  end  earlier  -  by  refinancing  or  sale.  Then  you  are  back  to  square  one  with  another  mandatory  escrow;  so  paying  the  fee  is  probably  not  a  good  idea.  If  you  are  an  interesting  borrower  for  other  banks,  you  might  be  able  to  refinance  with  no  escrow;  you  can  always  try  to  negotiate  this  and  make  it  a  part  of  the  contract.  If  they  want  your  business,  they  might  agree  to  that.
310748	Be  aware  that  ATM  withdrawals  often  generate  hidden  fees,  which  are  not  obviously  declared.  Many  banks  operate  e.g.  with  a  currency  exchange  fee,  giving  you  an  exchange  rate  some  1-2%  lower  than  actually  applicable.  If  you  withdraw  larger  amounts,  such  a  currency  exchange  fee  easily  adds  up  to  what  you  would  have  paid  for  a  wire  transfer,  where  you  would  get  a  better  exchange  rate.  Although  it's  probably  much  hassle  for  you  to  change  banks,  another  option  may  be  to  find  a  bank  which  operates  both  in  France  and  the  US.  Banks  with  different  national  branches  often  offer  cheap  and  fast  wire  transfers  between  same-bank  accounts  in  different  countries.  E.g.  Citibank  used  to  offer  such  services,  but  I  am  not  sure  if  they  still  serve  private  customers  in  France.
333023	I  faced  something  similar  for  travel  or  work  reasons,  and  as  for  me  I  preferred  wire  transfer  over  credit  card  withdrawals  because  my  bank  has  huge  fees.  My  thoughts  so  far  are:  the  fee  can  vary  a  lot  for  credit  card.  As  for  me,  I  can  expect  5%  fees  on  foreign  withdrawals.  But  I  considered  changing  bank  and  I  think  a  Gold  (or  premium)  card  might  be  a  good  idea  as  well.  The  idea  is  you  pay  a  big  subscription  (100  euros  or  so)  but  have  no  fee.  The  total  of  withdrawal  fees  could  easily  (if  you  stay  long  abroad)  reach  this  amount.  There  are  also  banks  like  HSBC  that  offer  low  fees  on  withdrawals  abroad,  you  can  ask  them.  The  problem  is  that  you  cannot  really  withdraw  huge  amounts  to  lower  the  fee  (since  you  carry  this  cash  in  the  street).  for  wire  transfers  the  total  fee  is  usually  $50  or  more  (I  had  a  fee  from  distant  bank,  a  fee  for  change  and  a  fee  in  my  home  bank).  But  the  amount  is  unlimited  (or  high  enough  to  be  of  little  matter)  and  I  needed  to  do  this  once  per  year  or  so.  So  I  guess  it  could  be  interesting  if  you  have  enough  savings  to  only  transfer  money  every  couple  of  months  or  so.  I  think  Western  Union  is  also  involved  this  profitable  business.  I  never  used  it  because  the  fees  are  pretty  high,  but  maybe  it  is  useful  for  not  too  big  amounts  frequently  transfered.  Actually,  have  you  considered  a  loan?  It's  a  very  random  idea  but  maybe  you  can  use  a  loan  as  a  swap  and  then  transfer  money  when  you  have  enough  to  reimburse  it  all.  But  the  question  is  very  interesting,  I  think  the  business  is  pretty  huge  due  to  globalization.  It  is  expensive  because  some  people  can  make  a  lot  of  money  out  of  it.
204677	Several  possibilities  come  to  mind:  Several  online  currency-exchange  brokers  (such  as  xe.com  and  HiFx)  offer  very  good  exchange  rates  and  no  wire  transfer  fees  (beyond  what  your  own  bank  might  charge  you).    Get  French  and  American  accounts  at  banks  that  are  part  of  the  Global  ATM  alliance:  BNP  Paribas  in  France  and  Bank  of  America  in  the  USA.    This  will  eliminate  the  ATM  fee.  Get  an  account  at  a  bank  that  has  branches  in  both  countries.    I've  used  HSBC  for  this  purpose.
486681	One  way  is  to  wire  transfer  large  amounts.  If  you  transfer  $5,000  at  one  go,  that  $50  fee  works  out  to  1%,  same  as  the  $5  on  a  $500  ATM  withdrawal  (and  ATM  fees,  hidden  and  explicit,  tend  to  be  higher  than  $5).    The  downside  is  exchange  rate  risk  (taking  more  money  at  one  go  exposes  you  to  that  day's  rate,  good  or  bad,  vs  taking  it  in  multiple  chunks).  If  you're  American,  you  also  have  to  report  large  transfers  and  foreign  balances  on  your  taxes.  Shopping  around  for  a  good  home  bank  (with  low  wire  &  foreign  ATM  fees),  is  quite  important.
355344	I  did  some  empirical  research,  comparing  the  exchange  rates  for  wire  transfers  vs.  the  exchange  rates  for  ATM  withdrawals.  With  my  bank,  wire  transfers  typically  take  a  4%  float  off  the  exchange  rate.  ATM  withdrawals  seem  to  take  just  over  2%.  And  ATM  withdrawals  don't  have  a  wire  transfer  fee,  as  long  as  I'm  withdrawing  from  a  branch  of  the  same  bank  (overseas).  The  only  problem  with  ATM  withdrawals  is  the  daily  limit.  As  far  as  I  can  see,  Tor's  answer  above  has  it  completely  backwards,  at  least  with  my  bank,  ATM  withdrawals  are  a  much  better  value.  Do  the  research  yourself...call  the  bank  you're  going  to  transfer  from  and  find  out  what  their  current  exchange  rate  is.  Compare  it  to  the  current  spot  rate  (e.g.  XE.com)  to  determine  how  much  of  a  cut  the  bank  is  taking.  Then,  if  you  can,  withdraw  some  cash  from  the  foreign  location  with  your  ATM  card  and  see  how  much  of  the  original  currency  is  deducted  from  your  account.  In  this  way  you  can  empirically  discover  for  yourself  the  better  rate.
140016	My  preferred  method  of  doing  this  is  to  get  a  bank  draft  from  the  US  in  Euros  and  then  pay  it  into  the  French  bank  (my  countries  are  Canada  and  UK,  but  the  principle  is  the  same).  The  cost  of  the  bank  draft  is  about  $8,  so  very  little  more  than  the  ATM  method.  If  you  use  bigger  amounts  it  can  be  less  overall  cost.  The  disadvantage  is  that  a  bank  draft  takes  a  week  or  so  to  write  and  a  few  days  to  clear.  So  you  would  have  to  plan  ahead.  I  would  keep  enough  money  in  the  French  account  for  one  visit,  and  top  it  up  with  a  new  bank  draft  every  visit  or  two.
408723	Check  global  ATM  alliance  they  are  banks  that  use  reciprocal  benefits  on  each  other  in  other  countries  without  fees.  For  example  the  in  the  USA  Bank  of  America  and  In  France  it  is  BNP  Paribas.  Both  are  banks  in  this  alliance.  I  use  this  option  between  the  United  States  and  the  Caribbean  my  banks  of  choice  are  Bank  of  America  in  the  US  and  in  the  Caribbean  I  use  Scotia  Bankand  since  I  have  accounts  in  both  weekends  I  can  use  both  ATM  cards  on  any  of  these  two  banks  without  any  processing  fees!!!!    You  should  check  the  global  ATM    alliance  to  see  if  it  is  an  option  that  you  could  use.
554700	Depending  on  your  income/savings  level  and  who  you  work  for  (if  you  work  for  a  big  company  check  with  an  HSBC  Premier  advisor,  they  may  waive  the  requirements),  you  may  qualify  for  an  HSBC  Premier  account,  which  can  allow  you  to  open  accounts  in  different  countries  and  transfer  money  between  them  without  a  fee.  You  can  also  get  a  Premier  account  without  meeting  the  requirements  if  you  are  willing  to  pay  a  monthly  fee,  but  I  doubt  that  will  be  worth  it  in  the  long  run  for  what  you  need  (worth  doing  the  math  though  if  you  travel  frequently).    NOTE:  There  may  be  similar  offerings  from  other  banks,  but  this  is  just  the  only  one  I'm  aware  of.
194730	I  haven't  seen  this  answer,  and  I  do  not  know  the  legality  of  it,  as  it  could  raise  red  flags  as  to  money  laundering,  but  about  the  only  way  to  get  around  the  exchange  rate  spreads  and  fees  is  to  enter  into  transactions  with  a  private  acquaintance  who  has  Euros  and  needs  Dollars.  The  problem  here  is  that  you  are  taking  on  the  settlement  risk  in  the  sense  that  you  have  to  trust  that  they  will  deposit  the  euros  into  your  French  account  when  you  deposit  dollars  into  their  US  account.  If  you  work  this  out  with  a  relative  or  very  close  friend,  then  the  risk  should  be  minimal,  however  a  more  casual  acquaintance  may  be  more  apt  to  walk  away  from  the  transaction  and  disappear  with  your  Euros  and  your  Dollars.  Really  the  only  other  option  would  be  to  be  compensated  for  services  rendered  in  Euros,  but  that  would  have  tax  implications  and  the  fees  of  an  international  tax  attorney  would  probably  outstrip  any  savings  from  Forex  spreads  and  fees  not  paid.
579007	I  think  the  one  single  answer  is  that  the  answer  depends  on  the  two  countries  involved  and  their  banks'  practices.  To  find  that  answer,  you  need  to  ask  other  expats  from  your  country  living  in  France  and  ask  them  for  their  experience.    Note  that  most  expats  do  not  know  what  fees  they  are  paying.  For  example,  in  the  Philippines,  the  lowest  fee  charged  still  involves  waiting  30  days  to  get  your  money.    Specifically,  I  opened  a  US  dollar  savings  account  with  the  minimum  of  US  $500  required  (other  rules  are  involved  for  opening  a  bank  account),  deposited  a  personal  check  drawn  on  my  US  bank  account  (no  fee  charged),  and  waited  30  calendar  days  to  withdraw  USD  bills.    The  Philippines  bank  did  not  have  a  branch  in  the  US,  but  had  financial  arrangements  with  US  banks.    After  getting  USD  dollars  in  my  hand,  I  walked  to  a  nearby  exchange  business  store  (which  usually  offered  a  better  daily  rate  than  a  bank,  but  a  rate  between  the  banks'  buy  and  sell  rates)  and  exchange  the  dollars  for  pesos.    Note  that  years  ago,  banks  did  not  give  USD  bills,  when  dollars  were  scarce  in  the  Philippines.  However,  this  process  does  not  work  in  Thailand,  due  to  bank  rules  against  private  individuals  opening  a  USD  account,  with  exceptions.    And  there  are  still  fees  involved.  March  2017
48404	It  depends  on  the  seller.    If  the  seller  wants,  they  can  collect  the  information  from  you  and  send  it  to  the  payment  gateway.    In  that  case,  they  of  course  have  everything  that  you  provide  at  some  point.    They  are  not  supposed  to  keep  the  security  code,  and  there  are  rules  about  keeping  the  credit  card  number  safe.      The  first  four  digits  of  the  credit  card  number  often  indicate  the  bank,  although  smaller  banks  may  share.    But  for  example  a  Capital  One  card  would  indicate  the  bank.      Other  sellers  work  through  a  payment  gateway  that  collects  the  information.    Even  there,  the  seller  may  collect  most  of  the  information  first  and  send  it  to  the  gateway.    In  particular,  the  seller  may  collect  name,  email,  phone,  and  address  information.    And  in  general  the  gateway  will  reveal  that  kind  of  information.    They  will  not  give  the  seller  credit  card  info  other  than  the  name  on  the  card,  expiration  date,  and  possible  last  four  digits.    They  may  report  if  the  address  matches  the  card's  billing  address  (mismatched  addresses  may  mean  fraud).      Buying  through  someone  like  PayPal  can  provide  the  least  information.    For  a  digital  good,  PayPal  can  only  expose  the  buyer's  name  (which  may  be  a  business  name)  and  email  (associated  with  the  payment  account).    However  PayPal  still  has  the  other  information  and  may  expose  it  under  legal  action  (e.g.  if  the  credit  card  transaction  is  reversed  or  the  good  sold  is  illegal).    And  even  PayPal  will  expose  the  shipping  address  for  physical  goods  that  require  shipping.
128884	In  general,  a  warrant  is  a  security  issued  by  a  company  allowing  the  holder  to  purchase  a  certain  number  of  a  particular  class  of  shares  at  a  certain  price  for  a  particular  period  of  time.    They  differ  from  exchange  traded  options  (i.e.  calls  and  puts)  in  that  they  are  issued  by  the  company  that  issued  the  underlying  shares  that  they  allow  you  to  purchase  whereas  calls  and  puts  are  generally  written  by  other  investors.  The  other  big  difference  between  options  and  warrants  is  that  options  are  standardized.    Any  call  or  put  you  buy  on  a  particular  exchange  has  basically  the  same  set  of  rules  governing  use.    By  contrast,  a  warrant  may  have  all  kinds  of  stipulations  that  must  occur  before  you  can  execute,  such  as  price  events  (e.g.  only  if  the  stock  hits  a  certain  price)  or  business  events  (e.g.  only  if  the  company  elects  to  defer  payment  on  a  bond  issued  at  the  same  time  as  the  warrant).  Warrants  are  generally  a  bad  choice  for  small  and  inexperienced  investors  since  each  warrant  issue  is  different  and  you  often  need  a  lawyer  or  other  qualified  professional  to  fully  understand  all  to  possible  outcomes.
427145	In  Australia  there  are  2  type  of  warrants  (I  don't  know  if  it  is  the  same  in  the  US,  UK  and  other  countries),  the  first  are  trading  warrants  and  the  second  are  instalment  warrants.  The  trading  warrants  are  exactly  what  it  says,  they  are  used  for  trading.  They  are  similar  to  option  and  have  calls  and  puts.  As  Cameron  says,  they  differ  from  exchange  traded  options  in  that  they  are  issued  by  the  financial  companies  whereas  options  are  generally  written  by  other  investors.  Instalment  warrants  on  the  other  hand  are  usually  bought  and  sold  by  investors  with  a  longer  term  view.  There  are  no  calls  and  puts  and  you  can  just  go  long  with  them.  They  are  also  issued  by  financial  companies,  and  how  they  work  is  best  explained  through  an  example:  if  I  was  to  buy  a  stock  directly  say  I  would  be  paying  $50  per  share,  however  an  instalment  warrant  in  the  underlying  stock  may  be  offered  for  $27  per  warrant.  I  could  buy  the  warrant  directly  from  the  company  when  it  is  issued  or  on  the  secondary  market  just  like  shares.  I  would  pay  the  $27  per  warrant  upfront,  and  then  in  2  years  time  when  the  warrant  expires  I  have  the  choice  to  purchase  the  underlying  stock  for  the  strike  price  of  say  $28,  roll  over  to  a  new  issue  of  warrants,  sell  it  back  on  the  secondary  market,  or  let  it  expire,  in  which  case  I  would  receive  any  intrinsic  value  left  in  the  warrant.  You  would  have  noticed  that  the  warrant  purchase  price  plus  the  strike  price  adds  up  to  more  than  the  share  price  ($55  compared  to  $50).  This  is  the  interest  component  inherent  in  the  warrant  which  covers  the  borrowing  costs  until  expiry,  when  you  pay  the  second  portion  (the  strike  price)  and  receive  the  underlying  shares.  Another  difference  between  Instalment  warrants  and  trading  warrants  (and  options)  is  that  with  instalment  warrants  you  still  get  the  full  dividends  just  like  the  shares,  but  at  a  higher  yield  than  the  shares.

In  general:  If  you  have  some  sort  of  method  for  perfectly  identifying  Pump  and  Dump  schemes,  it's  possible  you  could  make  money  if  you  time  things  right,  but  that  timing  is  going  to  be  very  difficult  to  identify.
374819	Assuming  you  have  no  non-public  material  information,  it  should  be  perfectly  legal.  I  suspect  it's  not  a  great  idea  for  the  reasons  that  Joe  outlined,  but  it  should  be  legal.
501826	As  of  2014,  this  answer  is  deprecated.  Read  answer  here  for  recent  developments  up  to  January  2015.    You  can  get  a  free  credit  report  yearly,  but  you  don't  get  your  credit  score,  just  the  content  of  your  report.  This  is  useful  to  make  sure  your  credit  history  is  correct,  etc.  To  get  that,  visit  annualcreditreport.com.  Another  site  which  will  give  you  your  score  for  free,  really  free  with  no  strings  attached,  is  creditkarma.com,  which  gives  you  your  TransUnion  credit  score  and  full  TransUnion  credit  report.  The  site  is  run  by  TransUnion  and  supported  via  advertising.  At  this  point  Equifax  and  Experian  offer  similar  services  via  subscription,  but  not  for  free.  Update  8/14/2015:  CreditKarma  now  offers  the  Equifax  information  as  part  of  their  service.
420600	I  get  my  credit  scores  from  all  three  bureaus  for  free  -  no  gimmick.    I  use  a  combination  of  banks  that  offer  this  service  to  get  my  scores.    I  wrote  about  this  sometime  back  in  my  blog.  For  credit  report,  the  only  place  to  go  is  AnnualCreditReport.com.    I  space  it  out  so  that  I  get  one  every  4  months  since  there  is  a  once  a  year  restriction  per  bureau.
215138	I  visited  annualcreditreport.com  to  get  my  annual  credit  report.    It  is  only  the  report,  not  the  score  or  FICO  score.    This  is  the  only  outlet  I  know  of  that  allows  you  to  get  your  report  for  free,  without  a  bunch  of  strings  attached  or  crap  to  sign  up  for  and  cancel  later.  It  was  very  easy.    I  was  wary  of  putting  in  my  private  information,  but  how  else  can  they  possibly  pull  you  up?  Read  the  instructions  carefully.    You  go  to  each  bureau  to  fetch  your  report,  and  they  dutifully  give  you  a  free  report,  but  they  push  hard  to  try  and  sell  you  a  score  or  a  report  service.    It  is  easy  to  avoid  these  if  you  read  carefully.  Once  you  get  a  report,    you  have  print  it  out  or  you  can't  see  it  again  for  another  year.    Each  bureau  has  a  different  site,  with  different  rules,  and  different  identity  checks  to  get  in.    Again,  read  the  instructions  and  it  isn't  hard.  Instead  of  printing,  I  just  saved  the  page  as  HTML.    You  get  one  html  file  and  a  folder  with  all  the  images  and  other  stuff.    This  suits  me  but  you  might  like  to  print.  After  you  get  each  report,  you  have  to  click  a  link  to  back  to  the  annualcreditreport.com  site.    From  there  you  go  to  the  next  bureau.  Regarding  a  score.    Everybody  does  it  differently.    Free  Issac  does  FICO,  but  anybody  who  pulls  your  credit  can  generate  a  score  however  they  like,  so  getting  a  score  isn't  anywhere  near  as  important  as  making  sure  your  report  is  accurate.  You  can  use  credit.com  to  simulate  a  score  from  one  of  the  bureaus  (I  can't  easily  see  which  one  at  the  moment).    It  is  as  easy  as  annualcreditreport.com  and  I  have  no  issue  getting  a  simulated  score  and  report  card.
337817	I've  seen  credit  cards  that  provide  you  your  credit  score  for  free,  updated  once  a  month  and  even  charted  over  the  last  year.    Unfortunately  the  bank  I  used  to  have  this  card  with  was  bought  and  the  purchasing  bank  discontinued  the  feature.  Perhaps  someone  out  there  knows  of  some  cards  that  still  offer  a  feature  like  this?
368484	It  appears  that  you  already  know  this,  but  FICO  credit  scores  (as  controlled  by  Fair  Isaac  Corporation)  are  the  real  official  credit  scores,  and  FICO  takes  a  cut  on  their  production  no  matter  which  of  the  3  major  credit  bureaus  calculates  the  official  score  (all  using  slightly  different  methods).  Be  careful  when  obtaining  a  score  for  making  a  big  decision  that  it  is  a  FICO  score,  because  relatively  few  lenders  will  lend  based  on  a  non-FICO  score.  That  said,  some  non-FICO  scores  are  easy  to  obtain  and  can  be  roughly  translated  to  an  approximation  of  your  score.  Barclays  US/  Juniper  Bank  credit  cards  offer  a  free  Transunion  "TransRisk"(TM)  score.  The  TransRisk  score  is  a  900  point  scale,  while  the  FICO  score  is  an  850  point  scale.  This  is  a  simple  ratio  and  you  can  calculate  your  approximate  FICO  score  by  the  formula:
282067	Check  with  your  bank.    As  of  January,  2015,  the  following  banks  and  credit  unions  are  offering  free  credit-scores:  Announced,  in  the  pipeline:  Source:  Banks  to  offer  FICO  credit  scores  for  free  Personal  Experience:  I've  been  receiving  free  FICO  score  from  my  credit  union  for  more  than  6  months  now.  Advice:  Most  people  have  multiple  bank/credit-union  accounts.  The  FICO  score  will  be  the  same  whoever  offers  it.  If  none  of  your  financial  institutions  offer  you  a  free  credit-score  then  you  may  opt  for  free  services  like  creditkarma.com  or  other  paid  services.  None  of  them  are  the  widely  used  FICO  scores,  but  they  can  be  a  good  gauge  of  your  credit  standing.  Please  note  that  a  credit-score  is  number  summarizing  your  credit-report  and  should  not  be  confused.    In  the  news:
499180	Credit  Sesame  monitors  your  credit  score  for  free.    My  understanding  is  that  they  make  their  money  off  of  credit  card  referrals.
262270	Your  question  is  unclear  about  whether  you  are  moving  from  bi-weekly  payments  or  to  bi-weekly  payments.  Let's  calculate  each  case.  Bi-weekly  pay  means  you  will  be  paid  every  two  weeks.  The  amount  for  each  payment  will  be  your  annual  salary  divided  by  26,  possibly  with  a  small  decrease  (around  0.3%)  to  account  for  the  fact  that  years  are  slightly  longer  than  52  weeks  (i.e.  there  are  slightly  more  than  26  two-week  periods  in  a  year),  and  possibly  an  even  smaller  adjustment  to  take  account  of  the  fact  that  some  years  are  a  day  longer  than  that.  You  will  be  paid  literally  every  14  days  (with  some  adjustments  if  a  payday  falls  on  a  holiday)  If  you  are  going  to  be  paid  twice  a  month,  then  each  payment  will  be  your  annual  salary  divided  by  24.  Typically  you  are  paid  on  the  same  days  of  each  month  -  for  example  the  1st  and  the  fifteenth,  or  the  last  business  day  before  those.
70357	Biweekly  pay  for  salaried  employees  is  typically  calculated  as  Annual-salary  /  26.  Twice  a  month  pay  for  salaried  employees  is  typically  calculated  as  Annual-salary  /  24.  If  you  were  getting  paid  twice  a  month  and  now  are  getting  paid  every  other  week,  your  paycheck  will  be  roughly  (  Twice-a-month-paycheck-amount  *  24  /  26  ).    If  you  were  paid  $1000  twice  a  month,  you'll  be  paid  $923  every  other  week.      $1000  *  24  =  $24K  and  $923  *  26  =  $24K.      You  will  get  paid  every  other  week  regardless  of  month  boundaries  on  a  biweekly  pay  cycle.
212589	One  point  that  I  don't  see  covered  in  the  other  answers  yet:  How  does  this  affect  the  months  that  have  5  weeks.  Do  we  actually  lose  two  weeks  a  year?  I  get  paid  every  two  weeks,  and  pay  day  is  always  a  Friday.    Some  months,  I  get  paid  3  times  -  which  is  always  great.    If  you  live  within  your  means,  it's  like  an  extra  paycheck.    All  other  months,  I  get  paid  two  times.    How  many  months  a  year  do  I  get  paid  3  times?  2.    It  will  always  be  two,  because  there  are  12  months.    If  you  get  paid  twice  a  month,  that's  24  pay  checks,  which  is  2  shy  of  26  pay  checks  -  what  we  would  expect  if  we  were  paid  every  two  weeks.    That  means  those  2  extra  pay  checks  need  to  fall  somewhere,  and  they  will  be  on  the  months  where  your  pay  day  is  hit  5  times.    For  example,  in  2014,  there  are  4  months  with  5  Fridays:  Jan  May  Aug  Oct    I  got  paid  the  second  Friday  of  January,  so  I  only  got  2  checks  in  January.    I  will  be  paid  on  the  first  Friday  of  May,  which  means  I  will  get  3  checks  in  May.    My  other  triple-check  month  this  year  is  October,  so  of  course  I  am  only  going  to  be  paid  twice  in  August.
448790	This  entirely  depends  on  two  factors:  Now  let's  look  at  what  AppleCare  gives  you:  What  it  covers  is  any  manufacturing  defect.  It  also  covers  you  for  phone  support,  as  otherwise  it's  a  $49-per-incident  charge  even  for  simple  issues.  It  also  covers  any  software  issues  that  you  may  come  across  as  long  as  the  issues  pertain  to  Apple  software  or  the  operating  system  itself.  What  it  doesn't  cover  is  any  damage  caused  by  the  user.  If  you  snap  the  corner  of  the  screen,  drop  it,  spill  liquid  on  it,  modify  it,  etc...  then  you're  responsible  for  paying  the  repair  costs.  If  you're  outside  of  phone  support,  then  you're  going  to  have  to  pay  someone  to  fix  any  problems  you  come  across.  Now  if  we're  to  trust  this  handy  study  done  in  2009,  then  we  can  say  that  the  3-year  failure  rate  for  Macbooks  and  Macbook  Pros  is  17.4%.  We  could  go  ahead  and  say  that  $350  /  $2000  =  17.5%  so  the  chances  match  up,  but  what's  the  likelihood  that  Apple  is  going  to  cover  the  full  $2000?  Only  under  extreme  cases  are  you  losing  the  full  $2000  (theft,  shock  damage,  etc...),  and  those  are  all  cases  that  Apple  won't  cover  anyways.  Instead  we're  looking  at  cases  such  as  (Please  keep  in  mind  it  has  been  several  years  since  I  worked  for  Apple,  so  these  figures  may  be  off):  So  this  reduces  our  possible  savings  significantly.  Let's  then  also  look  at  what  the  warranty  becomes  after  they  fixed  a  part:  A  replacement  part  or  Apple  Product,  including  a  user-installable  part  that  has  been  installed  in  accordance  with  instructions  provided  by  Apple,  assumes  the  remaining  term  of  the  Warranty  or  ninety  (90)  days  from  the  date  of  replacement  or  repair,  whichever  provides  longer  coverage  for  you.  Which  means  in  this  case  that  you  have  a  90-day  warranty  after  they've  fixed  an  issue.  This  significantly  reduces  the  likelihood  of  a  same  part  going  bad  multiple  times  in  a  row.  Therefore  the  chances  of  that  $350  being  worthwhile  are  very  much  against  you.  Even  if  the  system  does  fail  in  some  way,  it  is  likely  that  the  repair  would  be  cheaper  than  the  AppleCare.  The  chances  of  running  into  a  repair  or  series  of  repairs  that  pays  for  the  AppleCare  and  then  some  are  astonishingly  low.  I  would  still  get  it  if  you  were  giving  it  to  someone  who  was  significantly  lacking  in  any  technology  concepts  (such  as  a  parent  or  grandparent)  as  they  are  more  likely  to  utilize  the  extended  phone  support,  especially  for  smaller  things  that  they  might  nag  you  about!
506194	In  general,  if  you  can  afford  to  replace  something,  you  are  able  to  "self-insure".    You  really  want  to  understand  a  little  of  the  statistics  before  you  can  make  a  generic  call,  but  my  rule  of  thumb  is  that  insurance  via  "extended  warranty"  is  rarely  a  good  deal.    Here  is  a  simple  expected  value  math  formula  you  can  apply  (when  the  >  is  true,  then  you  should  buy  it):  replacement  cost  x  likelihood  of  using  warranty  %  >  cost  of  insurance  You  can  then  back-compute,  what  is  the  likelihood  that  I'd  need  to  lose  this  item  to  break  even?    Given  your  numbers:  $2000  x  Y  >  $350  or  Y  >  (350/2000)  or  Y  >  17.5%  So  if  you  think  there  is  a  17.5%  or  greater  chance  that  you'll  need  to  have  you  system  replaced  (i.e.  not  just  a  simple  fix)  AND  (as  Scott  pointed  out)  you'll  be  able  to  actually  use  the  replacement  warranty  then  the  applecare  is  a  good  purchase.    Note,  this  only  applies  to  items  you  can  replace  out-of-pocket  without  significant  burden,  because  if  you  didn't  have  the  $10k  to  replace  your  car,  it  wouldn't  matter  if  the  insurance  wasn't  such  a  good  deal  (especially  if  you  need  the  car  to  get  to  work,  etc.)  So  the  obvious  question  is:  "Why  would  a  for-profit  company  ever  offer  insurance  on  something  they  are  statistically  likely  to  lose  money  on?"    The  obvious  answer  is  "they  wouldn't,"  but  that  doesn't  mean  you  should  never  buy  this  type  of  insurance,  because  you  may  have  statistically  significant  circumstances.  For  instance,  I  purchased  a  $40  remote  helicopter  as  a  gift  for  my  children.    I  also  paid  the  $5  for  a  "no  questions  asked"  warranty  on  it  because,  knowing  my  kids,  I  knew  there  was  a  nearly  100%  chance  they  would  break  it  at  least  once.    In  this  case,  this  warranty  was  well  worth  the  $5,  because  they  did  break  it!    Presumably  they  make  money  on  these  warranties  because  most  of  the  purchasers  of  the  plan  are  more  attentive  (or  too  lazy  to  make  the  claim)  than  in  this  case.  Edit  note:  I  incorporated  Scott's  comment  about  likelihood  of  being  able  to  utilize  the  warranty  into  a  combined  "likelihood  of  using  warranty"  term.    This  term  could  be  broken  up  into  likelihood  of  needing  replacement  x  likelihood  of  actually  getting  company  to  replace  it  I  didn't  do  this  above  because  it  makes  it  a  little  harder  to  understand,  and  may  not  be  a  major  factor  in  all  cases,  but  you  can  definitely  add  it  after  the  fact  (i.e.  if  there's  only  a  90%  chance  Applecare  will  pay  out  at  all,  then  divide  the  17.5%  by  0.9  to  get  19.4%  likelihood  of  needing  the  replacement  for  it  to  be  cost  effective).  More  complete  formulas  can  be  derived  also  (including  terms  for  full  replacement  costs  vs  repair  costs  and  including  terms  for  "deductible"  type  costs  or  shipping),  but  I'm  trying  to  keep  things  relatively  simple  for  those  who  aren't  statistics  nerds  like  I  am.
265177	In  regards  to  purchasing  full  coverage  on  your  car  even  if  you  can  afford  to  replace  it,  consider  the  hassle  you  have  to  deal  with  an  accident  that  is  not  just  the  cost.    As  an  example,  my  sister's  car  was  stolen  and  wrecked.    It  was  her  problem  to  go  recover  the  car  on  the  other  side  of  the  state  such  that  she  would  not  be  paying  the  storage  "fees"  imposed  by  the  sheriff  of  the  other  county.    Had  she  had  insurance  they  would  have  taken  care  of  it  call.  Another  story  is  that  I  rented  a  car  and  side  swiped  in  the  parking  lot  by  a  hit  and  run.    I  was  responsible  for  the  minor  damage.    I  started  down  the  path  of  paying  out  of  pocket  because  it  was  small  enough  that  I  did  not  want  to  submit  a  claim.    The  rental  car  agency  started  to  pile  on  extra  fees  such  that  it  was  worth  it  to  turn  in  a  claim.    My  insurance  company  was  savvy  enough  to  be  able  to  dispute  the  extra  charges.    After  I  submitted  it  to  the  insurance  company  I  basically  did  nothing.    They  took  care  of  everything.  So,  in  summary,  when  you  buy  full  coverage  on  your  car,  it  is  not  just  a  financial  decision.    It  is  also  about  not  having  to  deal  with  a  hassle.
501432	The  answer  to  this  question  is  very  different  depending  on  the  type  of  item.    From  a  purely  financial  perspective  you  would  want  to  answer  these  questions  which  you  may  not  have  enough  information  to  answer:  Realistically  the  question  I  prefer  to  ask  are:  When  something  fails  there  is  a  big  difference  to  me  between  having  the  cash  and  having  an  insurance  policy  that  is  suppose  to  cover  it  even  if  they  are  theoretically  the  same  value.    Some  insurance  policies  may  even  be  better  than  cash,  like  homeowners  insurance  might  help  take  care  of  details  like  finding  a  contractor  to  fix  the  issue,  finding  temporary  housing  if  your  house  burns  down,  etc.
184210	Insurance  is  for  events  that  are  both  and  Unexpected  and,  for  many  people,  catastrophic  events  are,  for  example,  sickness,  disability,  death,  car  accidents,  house  fires,  and  burglaries,  for  which  you  may  buy  health,  disability,  life,  auto,  home,  and  renter's  insurance.    It  may  be  catastrophic  for  a  family  relying  on  a  very  old  earner  for  that  earner  to  die,  and  you  can  buy  life  insurance  up  to  a  very  old  age,  but  the  premiums  will  reflect  the  likelihood  of  someone  of  that  age  dying  within  the  covered  period.    The  more  expected  an  event  is,  the  more  anything  referred  to  as  insurance  is  actually  forced  savings.  Health  insurance  with  no  copays  on  regular  checkups  expects  the  insured  to  use  them,  so  the  cost  of  those  checkups  plus  a  profit  for  the  insurance  company  is  factored  into  the  premiums  ahead  of  time.    A  wooden  pencil  breaking  may  be  unexpected.  Regardless  of  foreseeability,  no  one  buys  insurance  on  wooden  pencils,  as  the  loss  of  a  pencil  is  not  catastrophic.  What  is  catastrophic  can  be  context  dependent.  Health-care  needs  are  typically  unforeseeable,  as  you  don't  know  when  you'll  get  sick.  For  a  billionaire,  needing  health-care,  while  unforeseeable,  the  situation  would  not  be  catastrophic,  and  the  billionaire  can  easily  self-insure  his  or  her  health  to  the  same  extent  as  most  caps  offered  by  health  insurance  companies.  If  you're  on  a  fixed  budget  buying  a  laptop,  if  it  unexpectedly  failed,  that  would  be  catastrophic  to  you,  so  budgeting  in  the  cost  of  insurance  or  an  extended  warranty  while  buying  your  laptop  would  probably  make  sense.  Especially  if  you  need  that  $2000  laptop,  spending  an  extra  17.5%  would  safeguard  against  you  having  to  come  out  of  pocket  and  depleting  your  savings  to  replace  it,  even  though  that  brings  you  to  a  grand  total  of  $2350  before  taxes.  However,  if  you're  in  that  tight  of  a  situation,  I  would  strongly  recommend  you  to  find  a  less  expensive  option  that  would  allow  you  to  self-insure.  If  you  found  a  used  laptop  for  much  less  (I  can  even  see  Apple  selling  refurbished  Macs  for  less  than  $1000)  you  might  decide  that  your  budget  allows  you  to  self-insure,  and  you  could  profit  from  being  careful  with  your  hardware  and  resolving  to  cover  any  issues  with  it  yourself.
561461	Extended  warranty  or  insurance  is  a  tricky  thing.    In  general,  the  big  screen  TV,  or  other  electronics  are  going  to  become  obsolete  before  they  fail.  Laptops,  even  Macs,  are  at  risk  for  higher  failure  rates  than  other  electronics.    The  question  remaining  is  whether  after  the  item  has  reached  its  3rd  or  4th  birthday,  if  you  would  already  be  in  the  market  for  a  newer  model.    In  the  big  picture,  if  you  have  the  money  to  buy  a  new  replacement,  or  pay  for  a  repair,  you  are  better  off  to  avoid  the  insurance.  The  highest  failures  are  in  the  first  year  (aka  'infant  mortality')  and  after  N  years,  closer  to  7-10,  enough  for  obsolescence,  than  in  years  2-5.
417091	As  a  rule,  purchasing  fairly  priced  (minus  a  spread)  insurance  on  items  you  can  afford  to  replace  is  a  bad  idea.  However,  in  addition  to  the  points  mentioned  in  the  previous  answers,  one  should  note  that  many  types  of  insurance  are  UNDERpriced  because  on  average  people  do  not  make  claims  even  though  they  are  entitled  to  them.    If  you  purchase  something  moderately  priced  at  Best  Buy  and  get  the  extended  warranty  and  it  breaks  down  a  year  later,  you  will  be  unlikely  to  even  remember  that  you  purchased  the  insurance  much  less  go  through  the  trouble  of  making  a  claim.    More  likely  you  will  just  go  buy  a  replacement  or  whatever  the  latest  and  greatest  iteration  is.    It's  like  homeowner's  insurance--an  amazing  number  of  things  is  covered  but  no  one  ever  makes  claims,  so  it  is  cheap.    If  you  are  a  person  who  remembers  and  utilizes  warranties  and  insurance,  there  are  many  types  of  insurance  that  will  save  you  money  in  expectation.      The  other  thing  is  that  you  know  more  about  your  own  riskiness  than  the  insurer  does.    I  had  a  girlfriend  who  bought  super  comprehensive  insurance  on  her  crappy  old  car.    I  was  quite  stern  with  her  about  it  but  could  not  change  her  mind.    She  totaled  it  a  few  months  later.    They  bought  her  a  replacement.    She  got  in  a  more  serious  accident  with  that  car  and  got  yet  another  one  in  addition  to  payment  of  her  medical  care,  which  did  not  even  go  to  her  health  care  insurance.    Yes,  her  rates  went  up,  but  not  fast  enough  to  deal  with  how  risky  she  was.    Another  example:  I  used  to  carry  an  e-book  reader  around  in  my  shirt  pocket  and  read  it  any  time  I  had  a  chance.    Cheap  item  and  not  that  delicate,  but  since  I  had  it  with  me  all  the  time  and  used  it  constantly,  it  was  a  big  risk  for  the  store.    The  extended  warranty  would  have  been  a  great  idea.  In  short,  avoid  extended  warranties  and  insurance  on  things  you  can  afford  to  lose  unless  you  know  that  you  are  high  risk  or  are  otherwise  more  likely  than  average  to  make  a  claim.
210676	As  many  other  posters  have  pointed  out,  unless  you  know  (and  your  insurer  doesn't)  that  because  of  any  reason  you  are  more  likely  than  the  average  to  damage  your  computer,  insuring  it  doesn't  really  make  a  lot  of  sense  if  you  can  comfortably  replace  it  should  the  worst  happen.  In  this  particular  case  of  a  laptop,  insurance  is  especially  unattractive  because  computers  depreciate  fairly  quickly.  If  you  break  it...  ...and  you're  insured,  you  will  get  the  very  same  laptop  you  bought  more  than  a  year  ago.  ...and  you're  not  insured,  you  can  choose  to  either  find  the  same  laptop  at  a  substantially  lower  price  (Apple  does  not  really  lower  prices  that  much  but  you  can  probably  get  a  refurbished  unit,  just  like  you  could  get  with  AppleCare)  or  spend  the  original  amount  in  a  newer  and  more  powerful  laptop.
176397	Generically,  like  farnsy  noted  in  the  other  answer,  you  will  only  come  ahead  in  dollar  terms  when  you  are  significantly  riskier  than  the  average  insuree.  Otherwise  the  insurance  company  would  have  higher  rates  to  make  a  profit.  In  the  case  of  Apple  Care  there  can  arguably  be  other  factors  involved.  If  you  did  not  insure  your  $2000  laptop  and  it  broke  (unfixably)  just  after  the  warranty  period,  would  you  replace  it  with  a  new  Apple  product?  Maybe  not,  so  Apple  could  lose  a  customer.  That  means  they  have  an  incentive  to  keep  you  happy.  If  your  product  breaks  but  insurance  replaces  it,  you  are  a  happier  customer  and  more  likely  to  buy  other  Apple  products.  This  is  not  an  incentive  for  traditional  insurance  companies  that  only  do  business  in  insurance.  Now,  with  the  profit  margins  Apple  likes  in  general,  I  don't  know  if  they've  underpriced  their  insurance.  I  sort  of  doubt  it  even.  But  their  margins  on  it  are  probably  not  high,  meaning  it's  a  closer  call  even  if  you  are  only  averagely  risky.
9152	The  key  point  to  answer  the  question  is  to  consider  risk  aversion.  Assume  I  suggest  a  game  to  you:  Throw  a  coin  and  if  you  win,  you  get  $5,  if  you  lose  nothing  happens.  Will  you  play  the  game?  Of  course,  you  will  -  you  have  nothing  to  lose!  What  if  I  suggest  this:  If  you  win,  you  get  $10,000,005  and  if  you  lose  you  must  pay  $10,000,000  (I  also  accept  cars,  houses,  spouses,  and  kidneys  as  payment).  While  the  expected  value  of  the  second  game  is  the  same  as  for  the  first,  if  you  lose  the  second  game  you  are  more  or  less  doomed  to  spend  the  rest  of  your  life  in  poverty  or  not  even  have  a  rest  of  your  life.  Therefore,  you  will  not  wish  to  play  the  second  game.  Well,  maybe  you  do  -  but  probably  only  if  you  are  very,  very  rich  and  can  easily  afford  a  loss  (even  if  you  had  $11,000,000  you  won't  be  as  happy  with  a  possible  raise  to  $21,000,005  as  you'd  be  unhappy  with  dropping  to  a  mere  $1,000,000,  so  you'd  still  not  like  to  play).    Some  model  this  by  taking  logarithms:  If  your  capital  grows  from  $500  to  $1000  or  from  $1000  to  $2000,  in  both  cases  it  doubles,  hence  is  considered  the  same  "personal  gain",  effectively.  And,  voíla,  the  logartithm  of  your  capital  grows  by  the  same  amount  in  both  cases.  This  refelcts  that  a  rich  man  will  not  be  as  happy  about  finding  a  $10  note  as  a  poor  man  will  be  about  finding  a  nickel.    The  effect  of  an  insurance  is  that  you  replace  an  uncertain  event  of  great  damage  with  a  certain  event  of  little  damage.  Of  course,  the  insurance  company  plays  the  same  game,  with  roles  swapped  -  so  why  do  they  play?  One  point  is  that  they  play  the  game  very  often,  which  tends  to  nivel  the  risks  -  unless  you  do  something  stupid  and  insure  all  inhabitants  of  San  Francisco  (and  nobody  else)  against  eqarthquakes.  But  also  they  have  enough  capital  that  they  can  afford  to  lose  the  game.  In  a  fair  situation,  i.e.  when  the  insurance  costs  just  as  much  as  damage  cost  multiplied  with  probability  of  damage,  a  rational  you  would  eagerly  buy  the  insurance  because  of  risk  aversion.  Therefore,  the  insurance  will  in  effect  be  able  to  charge  more  than  the  statistically  fair  price  and  many  will  still  (gnawingly)  buy  it,  and  that's  how  they  make  a  living.  The  decision  how  much  more  one  is  willing  to  accept  as  insurance  cost  is  also  a  matter  of  whether  you  can  afford  a  loss  of  the  insured  item  easily,  with  regrets,  barely,  or  not  all.
383870	Another  factor  to  consider  is  that  resale  value  of  the  laptop  is  quite  bit  more  if  it  is  still  under  warranty.    This  would  apply  to  people  who  replace  their  laptop  often.  It  is  higher  because  the  purchaser  can  be  assured  they  are  not  getting  a  lemon.    I  determined  this  by  comparing  prices  on  ebay  before  selling  my  computer.  Of  course,  if  you  keep  your  laptop  longer  than  the  warranty,  this  means  nothing.    But  for  me  it  meant  I  could  sell  my  old  laptop  quickly  and  for  a  better  price.  Because  I  used  my  laptop  for  work  and  totally  depended  on  it,  even  one  day  of  downtime  would  cost  me  a  lot,  so  it  was  worthwhile  to  keep  a  relatively  new  laptop  under  warranty.  Also,  for  those  using  Apple  Care,  there  is  an  undocumented  perk:    Apple  covered  an  out  of  warranty  repair  on  a  time  capsule  under  my  apple  care  for  my  laptop  even  tho  they  were  not  purchased  at  the  same  time.
154180	Can  you  afford  to  replace  it?  What  does  that  mean?    Even  if  insuring  means  overpaying,  it  does  spread  the  risk.    NB:  This  example  is  not  about  the  Applecare  program,  which  I  think  is  a  waste  of  money  for  many  people.  Others  have  explained  very  well  if  it  would  work  for  you  or  not.    I  have  a  Macbook  but  no  Applecare.  I  have  an  expensive  smartphone  with  insurance  for  dropping  and  water  damage,  but  not  theft.  After  one  year  I  cancel  this  insurance.  I  don't  have  $200K  in  my  bank  account.
528430	There  are  several  aspects  to  this  but  at  a  high  level  it  boils  down  to  A  lot  goes  in  to  insurance  rating  and  risk  projecting.    You  can't  adjust  a  single  variable  and  expect  a  proportional  change  in  your  premium,  7,000  miles  per  year  just  won't  be  70%  of  the  cost  of  10,000  miles  per  year,  because  there  are  a  lot  of  other  things  in  play  as  well.    To  further  address  premium  adjustments.    Consider  this:  Even  if  your  liability  coverage  did  scale  with  perfect  correlation  to  your  mileage  (using  the  same  70%  from  above,  7,000  miles  per  year  versus  10,000  miles  per  year)  then  your  premium  composition  is:  $200  to  $170  is  15%.    No  change  will  have  a  direct  linear  correlation  to  your  total  premium  because  there  are  different  component  pieces  of  the  total  premium.    Fixed  costs  may  be  built  in  to  the  amounts  for  other  component  pieces  of  the  premium,  for  example  maybe  no  line  of  coverage  ever  has  a  cost  below  $X.  Obviously  these  numbers  are  all  made  up  Additionally,  and  also  less  considered  is  the  fact  that  your  liability  also  scales  because  of  a  lot  of  factors  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  you.    It  might  be  the  other  cars  that  are  on  the  road,  it  might  be  that  more  densely  populated  areas  have  more  fender  benders.    For  example  if  you  live  in  Beverly  Hills  you  have  a  much  higher  likelihood  of  accidentally  bumping  a  $70-$80-$90-$100k+  car  than  you  do  in  say,  rural  Wisconsin.    If  your  zip  code  is  gentrifying  and  everyone  starts  buying  Mercedes,  your  liability  coverage  increases.      You  can  not  adjust  one  single  variable  and  decide  that  you  are  lower  risk  than  all  insurers  think  you  are.    If  you  shop  this  coverage  and  all  insurers  are  within  a  nominal  margin  of  pricing  for  the  same  coverage  levels,  there  isn't  much  to  argue  with;  you  are  simply  riskier  than  you  think  you  are  and  the  variable  you  are  focused  on  is  not  as  meaningful  as  you  think  it  is.
53755	Not  all  miles  carry  the  same  amount  of  risk.  A  survey  by  Progressive  indicated  that  accidents  are  most  likely  to  occur  within  5  miles  of  home,  and  77%  of  accidents  occur  within  15  miles  of  home.  Only  1%  of  accidents  occurred  50  or  more  miles  from  home.  That's  from  2002,  but  it  seems  unlikely  to  have  changed  much.  Since  the  miles  closest  to  your  home  carry  more  risk,  they  cost  more,  and  low-mileage  discounts  reflect  that.  There  are  per-mile  insurance  options  in  a  few  states  which  could  save  you  money,  but  they  do  constant  monitoring  via  that  ODB2  telematics  device,  and  other  insurers  offer  discounts  if  you  accept  their  monitoring  either  in  perpetuity  or  for  a  limited  period  of  time.    Without  monitoring,  insurers  don't  know  if  that  4,000  miles  of  driving  is  spread  into  a  few  mid-day  trips  each  week,  or  maybe  you're  doing  all  that  driving  from  midnight  to  4am  on  weekends  (fatalities  far  more  likely),  or  from  5-7pm  during  weekdays  (accidents  far  more  likely).  Personally,  I  save  ~10%  by  being  a  'low-mileage'  driver,  and  am  currently  in  the  middle  of  a  90-day  monitoring,  so  might  go  lower,  but  given  that  accidents  are  far  more  likely  close  to  home,  10%  feels  pretty  significant  and  appropriate.
351446	4000  miles  a  year  is  not  a  few!  European  average  is  about  9000...  But  nevertheless...  But  when  it  comes  to  risk,  then:  1)  Nothing  stops  you  from  changing  circumstances  and  drive  10  times  as  much  as  in  previous  yers.  The  insurance  remains  the  same.  The  only  thing  the  insurance  company  can  do  is  to  charge  you  more  next  year  (taking  the  miles  you've  made  this  year  as  a  basis  for  calculations)*  2)  Drivers  who  drive  very  seldom  are  a  huge  risk  because  of  their  low  experience.  I  know  a  few  people  that  drive  more  than  100  miles  only  a  few  times  a  year,  and  on  average  once  a  year  have  accident  during  that  drives.  It  doesn't  mean  that  an  average  sunday  driver  have  similar  risk  of  accident  as  daily  driver,  but  it's  in  no  way  similar.    *)  Germany/Switzerland  based,  the  whole  EU  is  likely  to  be  the  same
111764	Many  services  charge  prices  that  do  not  scale  linearly  with  usage.    This  is  because  the  service  provider  has  fixed  costs  that  they  must  recoup  by  charging  a  rate  with  a  fixed  component.    A  5-mile  taxi  ride  is  unlikely  to  cost  half  what  a  10-mile  taxi  ride  costs.    Even  a  half  sandwich  at  a  sandwich  place  usually  costs  more  than  half  of  what  a  full  sandwich  costs.    In  this  respect,  insurance  is  no  different  from  many  other  items  you  may  purchase.
458930	Some  proportion  of  the  costs  of  a  policy  have  little  to  no  relationship  to  miles  driven.    Think  of  costs  of  underwriting,  and  more  especially  sales/marketing/client  acquisition  costs  (auto  insurance  isn't  in  the  same  league  as  non-term  life  insurance  (where  the  commissions  and  other  selling  expenses  typically  exceed  the  first  year's  worth  of  premiums),  but  the  funny  TV  ads  and/or  agent  commissions  aren't  free),  as  well  as  general  business  overhead.  Also,  as  noted  by  quid,  some  proportion  of  claim  risk  isn't  correlated  to  distance  covered  (think  theft,  flood,  fire,  etc.).  There  are  also  differences  in  the  miles  that  are  likely  to  be  driven  by  a  non-commercial/vehicle-for-hire  driver  who  puts  25k  miles  a  year  vs.  one  who  puts  7k  per  year.    The  former  is  generally  going  to  be  doing  more  driving  at  higher  speeds  on  less-congested  freeways  while  the  latter  will  be  doing  more  of  their  driving  on  crowded  urban  roads.    The  former  pattern  generally  has  a  lower  expected  value  of  claims  both  due  to  having  fewer  cars  per  road-mile,  fewer  intersections  and  driveways,  and  also  having  any  given  collision  be  more  likely  to  result  in  a  fatality  (paralysis  or  other  lifetime  disability  claims  are  generally  going  to  exceed  what  the  insurer  would  pay  out  on  a  fatality).
107841	Other  people  lie  to  the  companies  about  how  many  miles  they  drive,  so  they  can't  take  the  mileage  figures  literally.      You  aren't  specifying  whether  you  want  liability  only,  or  more-comprehensive  insurance.    Stuff  happens  when  you  aren't  driving.    Cars  get  stolen.    Other  drivers  hit  parked  cars  and  leave.    Trees  fall  on  parked  cars.      Move  to  Virginia  where  insurance  is  not  required.      Just  pay  $500  a  year  for  not  having  insurance,  and  be  careful.
199598	First  you  have  to  understand  that  insurance  is  basically  a  social  system,  just  with  Shareholders.  Insurance  costs  consist  of  3  factors:  Now,  to  encourage  a  low-risk  behavior  a  separating  factor  is  search  in  the  vast  amount  of  statistical  data.  Drivers  experience,  miles  and  type  of  car  being  the  most  common,  but  also  other  things  like  oldtimer-status  etc.  are  possible.  If  it  so  happens  that  the  3-5000  miles  driver  do  only  in  average  have  80%  of  the  damage-costs  of  a  comparable  group  5-8000  miles  driver,  you´ll  get  the  20%  bonus  on  factor  1.    So  the  answer  is,  it  is  not  overpriced,  there  is  just  no  linear  relationship  to  mileage.  You  can´t  divide  your  insureds  in  too  many  groups  or  you´ll  miss  the  mutual  aspect  of  insurance.  If  everybody  just  pays  his  own  risk,  he  can  just  do  so  in  his  bank  and  save  on  overhead  and  profit.
362518	There  is  plenty  of  over-rationalisation  in  the  majority  of  these  answers,  when  the  simple  answer  is  that  it  is  simply  down  to  statistics.  Say  an  insurer  had  two  pieces  of  information  about  two  separate  drivers:  annual  mileage,  and  whether  they  had  had  an  accident  in  the  last  3  years.  Driver  A  drives  10,000  miles  a  year  and  hasn't  had  an  accident  in  the  past  3  years.  Driver  B  drives  500  miles  a  year  and  hasn't  had  an  accident  in  the  past  3  years.  Which  would  the  insurer  think  was  the  safer  bet?  The  answer  is  A,  and  this  makes  his  premiums  lower.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  the  insurer  has  a  lot  more  data  about  Driver  A  than  Driver  B:  they  know  that  Driver  A  has  driven  30,000  miles  without  having  an  accident.  This  could,  of  course,  be  luck,  or  a  fluke,  but  it  is  likely  that  Driver  A  is  actually  a  safe  driver.  The  chance  that  Driver  A  hasn't  had  an  accident  just  through  sheer  luck  and  that  they  are  actually  a  terrible  driver  is  quite  slim.  On  the  other  hand,  Driver  B  has  only  driven  1,500  miles  in  the  past  three  years.  Whilst  this  seems  like  prima  facie  evidence  of  them  being  as  safe  a  driver  as  Driver  A,  it  is  much  more  likely  that  Driver  B  could  have  driven  1,500  miles  and  avoided  an  accident  through  sheer  luck,  even  though  they  are  a  terrible  driver.    This  means  drivers  who  drive  low  amounts  of  mileage  will  be  penalised  relative  to  other  drivers  who  have  high  mileage.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  insurers  taking  a  judgement  that  'doing  more  mileage  makes  you  more  experienced'  or  'makes  you  a  better  driver'  as  others  have  suggested  here  (although,  it  is  probably  true  -  it's  not  quantifiable  from  an  insurer's  perspective).
168278	because  it  cost  the  insurer  more,  obviously.  while  this  sounds  snarky,  it's  important  to  realize  that  actual  insurance  companies  set  their  insurance  rates  based  on  actual  historical  costs.  for  some  reason  people  who  report  low  miles  have  cost  the  company  more  dollars  per  reported  mile  than  people  who  report  high  miles.  in  that  sense,  insurance  is  not  overpriced.  if  it  were  truly  overpriced,  then  an  insurer  would  specialize  in  such  insurance  and  make  a  killing  on  the  free  market.  the  more  interesting  questions  is  why  do  drivers  who  claim  to  travel  very  few  miles  cost  the  insurance  companies  so  much  per  mile?  that  question  has  a  host  of  possible  answers  and  it's  difficult  to  say  which  is  the  largest  cost.  here  are  just  a  few:
563482	One  reason  is  because  car  insurance  is  mandated.  Mandated  insurance  means  the  government  is  forcing  people  to  purchase  it,  which  also  means  that  everyone  must  have  the  opportunity  to  purchase  it  at  a  reasonable  cost,  even  if  the  insurer  would  normally  not  choose  to  insure  them.  In  mandated  industries,  risk  pools  are  formed  which  means  that  as  a  whole,  lower  risk  members  partially  subsidize  higher  risk  members.  In  mandated  industries  that  have  a  large  risk  variance,  the  insurance  system  would  break  down  if  everyone  was  charged  their  "fair  share"  because  high  risk  members  would  be  unable  to  afford  a  policy.  (This  is  even  more  prominent  with  health  insurance  than  car  insurance  because  the  difference  in  risk  is  vastly  greater.)  On  a  positive  note,  perhaps  you  may  get  a  warm  and  fuzzy  feeling  knowing  that  you  are  helping  out  others  "in  need".
344378	Insurance  rates  are  about  assessing  risk.    If  the  insurer  has  no  way  to  reliably  and  easily  assess  usage,  they  will  not  reduce  the  premiums.    Many  companies  are  providing  tracking  devices  that  connect  to  the  OBD-II  port.  This  not  only  tracks  actual  miles  driven,  but  can  typically  track  aggressive  driving,  time  of  day,  length  of  trips,  and  other  information.  Unless  you  are  using  this  kind  of  device  to  give  the  insurer  actionable  feedback  on  your  driving  habits,  do  not  expect  any  discounts  for  mileage  or  usage.
163043	People  who  drive  long  distances  tend  to  do  more  of  their  driving  on  larger,  well-built  roads  (freeways  /  motorways)  that  are  designed  for  high-speed  driving.  Although  some  people  find  them  intimidating,  they  are  much  safer  in  terms  of  accidents  per  kilometre  driven  for  several  reasons:
450740	If  I  knew  a  surefire  way  to  make  money  in  FOREX  (or  any  market  for  that  matter)  I  would  not  be  sharing  it  with  you.    If  you  find  an  indicator  that  makes  sense  to  you  and  you  think  you  can  make  money,  use  it.    For  what  it's  worth,  I  think  technical  analysis  is  nonsense.  If  you're  just  now  wading  in  to  the  FOREX  markets  because  of  the  Brexit  vote  I  suggest  you  set  up  a  play-money  account  first.    The  contracts  and  trades  can  be  complicated,  losses  can  be  very  large  and  you  can  lose  big  --  quickly.  I  suspect  FOREX  brokers  have  been  laughing  to  the  bank  the  last  couple  weeks  with  all  the  guppies  jumping  in  to  play  with  the  sharks.
311607	Speaking  from  stock  market  point  of  view,  superficially,  TA  is  similarly  applicable  to  day  trading,  short  term,  medium  term  and  long  term.  You  may  use  different  indicators  in  FX  compared  to  the  stock  market,  but  I  would  expect  they  are  largely  the  same  types  of  things  -  direction  indicators,  momentum  indicators,  spread  indicators,  divergence  indicators.  The  key  thing  with  TA  or  even  when  trading  anything,  is  that  when  you  have  developed  a  system,  that  you  back  test  it,  to  prove  that  it  will  work  in  bear,  bull  and  stagnant  markets.  I  have  simple  systems  that  are  fine  in  strong  bull  markets  but  really  poor  in  stagnant  markets.  Also  have  a  trading  plan.  Know  when  you  are  going  to  exit  and  enter  your  trades,  what  criteria  and  what  position  size.

You  don’t  pay  Capital  Gains  Tax  when  you  sell  (or  ‘dispose  of’)  your  home  if  all  of  the  following  apply:  As  I  look  at  it,  it  is  your  parents  are  the  ones  who  own  the  property  and  they  will  have  to  pay  on  £60000.  But  as  you  say  you  pay  part  of  the  mortgage,  I  would  go  to  a  tax  advisor/accountant  to  confirm  if  they  will  only  pay  on  the  £15000.  I  couldn't  find  any  guidance  on  that  matter  on  gov.uk  2)  Inheritance  tax  will  not  be  levied  on  it  as  it  is  below  £325000,  but  tax  will  be  levied  on  £325000,  less  £3000  annual  gift  allowance.

271658	They'll  refund  your  money  (though  maybe  with  a  small  service  charge).    I'm  sure  they  regularly  deal  with  new  car  sales  gone  wrong.
151098	tl;dr:  Call  them.  I'd  be  very  surprised  if  you  have  a  problem.  I  used  to  have  have  a  policy  with  Geico,  and  would  pay  for  my  car  insurance  6  months  at  a  time.  About  2  months  into  my  last  period,  I  purchased  a  house.  Unfortunately,  Geico  didn't  offer  homeowners  insurance  in  my  state,  so  I  ended  switching  to  another  company  that  offered  a  better  auto+home  combined  policy.    Since  I  had  already  paid  for  6  months  of  coverage,  I  figured  I'd  just  be  stuck  being  double-covered  for  4  months.  So,  I  didn't  bother  doing  anything  until  the  end  of  the  6  months  and  called  them  to  cancel  the  auto-renewal  thinking  what  I've  already  paid  was  a  sunk  cost.  The  asked  me  why  I  was  canceling  and  I  explained  the  situation  and  they  backdated  the  cancellation  to  when  I  got  my  policy  with  the  other  company  and  Geico  issued  me  a  refund  for  the  time  there  was  overlap.    Considering  that  they  did  that  for  a  leaving  customer,  I'd  expect  them  to  be  able  to  cancel  the  policy  on  a  new  car  of  a  current  paying  customer  with  no  issues.
574398	When  adding  a  new  or  used  car  to  the  policy  I  have  found  that  it  is  best  to  call  the  company  in  advance.  I  let  them  know  I  will  be  adding  a  car  to  the  policy  in  the  next  few  days,  but  I  have  no  idea  of  the  VIN  or  other  info.    I  have  a  policy  with  a  different  company  and  they  have  told  me  that  I  am  automatically  covered    as  long  as  I  provide  the  VIN  and  other  details  within  30  days.  The  next  business  day  after  the  purchase  I  provide  everything  they  need,  and  a  new  bill  is  generated.  When  removing  a  car  from  the  policy  it  has  worked  the  same  way,  a  new  bill  is  generated  when  removing  the  car.  Depending  on  the  timing  and  amounts  they  have  either  credited  my  account  or  sent  a  check.    They  should  have  no  problem  removing  a  car  that  was  accidentally  on  the  policy.  It  might  be  that  they  charge  you  a  days  coverage.  When  you  call  them  about  the  refund,  ask  if  the  coverage  for  an  additional  vehicle  is  automatic,  that  way  you  don't  have  to  provide  the  info  until  after  you  get  the  car  home.
347946	To  answer  your  question  briefly:  net  income  is  affected  by  many  things  inside  and  outside  of  management  control,  and  must  be  supplemented  by  other  elements  to  gain  a  clear  picture  of  a  company's  health.  To  answer  your  question  in-depth,  we  must  look  at  the  history  of  financial  reporting:  Initially,  accounting  was  primarily  cash-based.  That  is,  a  business  records  a  sale  when  a  customer  pays  them  cash,  and  records  expenses  when  cash  goes  out  the  door.  This  was  not  a  perfectly  accurate  system,  as  cashflow  might  be  quite  erratic  even  if  sales  are  stable  (collection  times  may  differ,  etc.).  To  combat  problems  with  cash-based  accounting,  financial  reporting  moved  to  an  accrual-based  system.  An  accrual  is  the  recording  of  an  item  before  it  has  fully  completed  in  a  cash  transaction.  For  example,  when  you  ship  goods  to  a  customer  and  they  owe  you  money,  you  record  the  revenue  -  then  you  record  the  future  collection  of  cash  as  a  balance  sheet  item,  rather  than  an  income  statement  item.  Another  example:  if  your  landlord  charges  you  rent  on  December  31st  for  the  past  year,  then  in  each  month  leading  up  to  December,  you  accrue  the  expense  on  the  income  statement,  even  though  you  haven't  paid  the  landlord  yet.  Accrual-based  accounting  leaves  room  for  accounting  manipulation.  Enron  is  a  prime  example;  among  other  things,  they  were  accruing  revenue  for  sales  that  had  not  occurred.  This  'accelerated'  their  income,  by  having  it  recorded  years  before  cash  was  ever  collectible.  There  are  specific  guidelines  that  restrict  doing  things  like  this,  but  management  will  still  attempt  to  accelerate  net  income  as  much  as  possible  under  accounting  guidelines.  Public  companies  have  their  financial  statements  audited  by  unrelated  accounting  firms  -  theoretically,  they  exist  to  catch  material  misstatements  in  the  financial  statements.  Finally,  some  items  impacting  profit  do  not  show  up  in  net  income  -  they  show  up  in  "Other  Comprehensive  Income"  (OCI).  OCI  is  meant  to  show  items  that  occurred  in  the  year,  but  were  outside  of  management  control.  For  example,  changes  in  the  value  of  foreign  subsidiaries,  due  to  fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  rates.  Or  changes  in  the  value  of  company  pension  plan,  which  are  impacted  by  the  stock  market.  However,  while  OCI  is  meant  to  pick  up  all  non-management-caused  items,  it  is  a  grey  area  and  may  not  be  100%  representative  of  this  idea.  So  in  theory,  net  income  is  meant  to  represent  items  within  management  control.  However,  given  the  grey  area  in  accounting  interpretation,  net  income  may  be  'accelerated',  and  it  also  may  include  some  items  that  occurred  by  some  'random  business  fluke'  outside  of  company  control.  Finally,  consider  that  financial  statements  are  prepared  months  after  the  last  year-end.  So  a  company  may  show  great  profit  for  2015  when  statements  come  out  in  March,  but  perhaps  Jan-March  results  are  terrible.  In  conclusion,  net  income  is  an  attempt  at  giving  what  you  want:  an  accurate  representation  of  the  health  of  a  company  in  terms  of  what  is  under  management  control.  However  it  may  be  inaccurate  due  to  various  factors,  from  malfeasance  to  incompetence.    That's  why  other  financial  measures  exist  -  as  another  way  to  answer  the  same  question  about  a  company's  health,  to  see  if  those  answers  agree.  ex:  Say  net  income  is  $10M  this  year,  but  was  only  $6M  last  year  -  great,  it  went  up  by  $4M!  But  now  assume  that  Accounts  Receivable  shows  $7M  owed  to  the  company  at  Dec  31,  when  last  year  there  was  only  $1M  owed  to  the  company.  That  might  imply  that  there  are  problems  collecting  on  that  additional  revenue  (perhaps  revenue  was  recorded  prematurely,  or  perhaps  they  sold  to  customers  who  went  bankrupt).    Unfortunately  there  is  no  single  number  that  you  can  use  to  see  the  whole  company  -  different  metrics  must  be  used  in  conjunction  to  get  a  clear  picture.
309388	This  is  determined  by  each  banking  institution.    In  general,  if  making  the  withdrawal  in  person,  the  limit  is  based  on  what  you  have  in  your  account,  but  many  ask  for  advance  notice  when  withdrawing  more  than  $5000.    They  may  still  allow  a  larger  withdrawal  without  notice,  but  usually  have  a  policy  in  place  and  will  tell  you  over  the  phone.    You  should  also  be  aware  that  the  bank  is  required  to  report  withdrawals  totaling  $10,000  or  more  in  a  day  to  the  treasury  department  and  may  require  extra  paper  work  (businesses  are  often  exempted  or  at  least  have  higher  amounts).  For  very  large  withdrawals,  you  would  definitely  have  to  wait,  but  you  may  not  be  able  to  get  an  answer  over  the  phone  as  to  how  long  unless  you  actually  have  $600K  on  deposit  at  that  bank.    They  will  have  some  kind  of  protocol  to  handle  such  a  request,  i.e.  teller  will  talk  to  a  manager,  who  may  have  to  make  a  call  to  a  regional  or  national  office  and  make  special  arrangements.  Most  branches  don't  want  to  have  their  regular  stash  of  cash  plus  an  extra  $600K  lying  around.    There  are  insurance  and  security  concerns.    The  increased  potential  for  theft  can  put  employees  and  other  customers  at  risk.    They  may  also  not  feel  comfortable  unloading  bags  of  money  from  their  vault  or  armored  truck  into  the  back  of  your  car.  While  this  is  a  very  uncommon  scenario,  it  has  actually  happened  before.    It  took  'weeks'  and  when  funds  were  available,  additional  security  and  police  escorts  were  called  in.  Edit:  You  can  find  summaries  of  the  regulations  here  and  here  and  more  complete  info  here.    In  general,  the  money  should  be  available  within  1-8  business  days  after  it  is  deposited  depending  on  the  nature  and  amount  of  the  deposit,  but  the  regulations  are  really  designed  for  more  ordinary  transactions.    For  a  $600K  withdrawal,  the  bank  can  cite  security  issues  and  decline  to  honor  the  request  in  cash.    If  you  ask,  your  bank  should  provide  their  standard  policy,  which  could  include  language  such  as  this:  We  require  prior  notice  for  large  cash  withdrawals.  We  can  refuse  an  order  to  withdraw  funds  in  cash  or  to  cash  an  item  if  we  believe  that  the  request  is  a  security  risk  or  possesses  a  hardship  on  the  Bank.  We  may  require  you  to  accept  an  Official  Check  or  electronic  transfer  to  receive  the  funds.  If  we  agree  to  a  large  cash  withdrawal,  you  may  be  required  to  employ  a  courier  service  acceptable  to  us  and  at  your  risk  and  expense.  If  a  large  cash  withdrawal  is  completed  at  a  branch  you  will  be  required  to  sign  a  cash  withdrawal  agreement.  Refusal  to  sign  the  agreement  is  grounds  for  us  to  revoke  the  cash  withdrawal  and  require  an  alternate  delivery  for  the  funds.  You  might  also  find  this  question  interesting.
340329	In  the  United  States,  many  banks  aim  to  receive  $  100  per  year  per  account  in  fees  and  interest  markup.    There  are  several  ways  that  they  can  do  this  on  a  checking  account.    These  examples  assume  that  there  is  a  3  %  difference  between  low-interest-rate  deposit  accounts  and  low-interest  rate  loans.  Or  some  combination  of  these  markups  that  adds  up  to  $  100  /  year.    For  example:    A  two  dollar  monthly  fee  =  $  24  /  year,  plus  a  $  2,000  average  balance  at  0.05%  =  $  29  /  year,  plus  $  250  /  month  in  rewards  debit  card  usage  =  $  24  /  year,  plus  $  2  /  month  in  ATM  fees  =  $  24  /  year.  Before  it  was  taken  over  by  Chase  Manhattan  in  2008,  Washington  Mutual  had  a  business  strategy  of  offering  "free"  checking  with  no  monthly  fees,  no  annual  fees,  and  no  charges  (by  Washington  Mutual)  for  using  ATMs.    The  catch  was  that  the  overdraft  fees  were  not  free.    If  the  customers  averaged  3  overdraft  fees  per  year  at  $  34  each,  Washington  Mutual  reached  its  markup  target  for  the  accounts.
351584	Generally,  the  paperwork  realtors  use  is  pre-written  and  pre-approved  by  the  relevant  State  and  real-estate  organizations.  The  offers,  contracts,  etc  etc  a  pretty  straightforward  and  standard.  You  can  ask  a  realtor  for  a  small  fee  to  arrange  the  documents  for  you  (smaller  than  the  usual  5%  sellers'  fee  they  charge,  I  would  say  0.5%  or  a  couple  of  hundreds  of  dollars  flat  fee  would  be  enough  for  the  work).  You  can  try  and  get  these  forms  yourself,  sometimes  you  can  buy  them  in  the  neighborhood  Staples,  or  from  various  law  firms  and  legal  plans  that  sell  standard  docs.  You  can  get  a  lawyer  to  go  over  it  with  you  for  almost  nothing:  I  used  the  LegalZoom  plan  for  documentation  review,  and  it  cost  me  $30  (business  plan,  individual  is  cheaper)  to  go  over  several  purchase  contracts  ($30  is  a  monthly  subscription,  but  you  don't  have  to  pay  it  for  more  than  one  month).  But  these  are  standard,  so  you  do  it  once  and  you  know  how  to  read  them  all.  If  you  have  a  legal  plan  from  work,  this  may  cover  document  review  and  preparation.  Preparing  a  contract  that  is  not  a  standard  template  can  otherwise  cost  you  hundreds  of  dollars.  Title  company  will  not  do  any  paperwork  for  you  except  for  the  deed  itself.  They  can  arrange  the  deed  and  the  recording,  escrow  and  title  insurance,  but  they  will  not  write  a  contract  for  the  parties  to  use.  You  have  to  come  with  the  contract  already  in  place,  and  with  escrow  instructions  already  agreed  upon.  Some  jurisdictions  require  using  a  lawyer  in  a  real-estate  transaction.  If  you're  in  a  jurisdiction  (usually  on  a  county  level)  that  requires  the  transaction  to  go  through  a  lawyer  -  then  the  costs  will  be  higher.
64005	Whether  or  not  you  use  a  real  estate  agent,  at  some  stage  most  people  use  a  lawyer  to  do  the  actual  buying  and  selling  and  set  up  the  agreements.  If  you've  never  dealt  with  a  lawyer  directly  before  it's  probably  because  your  agent  has  acted  as  a  front-person  for  the  lawyer.  If  you  go  to  a  lawyer  and  tell  them  what  you  want  to  do  they  will  sort  it  out,  and  should  tell  you  in  advance  how  much  it  will  cost.  You  and  your  friend  will  probably  need  one  each.
387908	For  a  real  estate  transaction  there  are  multiple  stages:  From  the  sellers  viewpoint:  From  the  buyers  viewpoint:  If  both  parties  are  comfortable  skipping  some  of  the  steps  the  role  of  the  agent  can  be  minimized.  How  will  a  fair  price  be  determined?  Some  realism  might  be  needed,  to  make  sure  that  the  loan  appraisal  will  not  be  a  problem.  Will  an  inspection  still  be  needed?  What  warranty  will  exist  if  the  A/C  dies  this  summer?    If  you  still  want  help  from  an  agent  one  should  be  able  to  help  for  far  less  than  the  normal  commission.  The  seller  normally  interviews  three  agents  before  selecting  one,  do  the  same  in  this  situation.  Ask  how  much  they  would  charge  for  a  sale  between  friends.  They  can  complete  their  task  in  just  a  couple  of  hours.  If  the  home  inspection  comes  back  relatively  clean,  the  transaction  should  be  very  easy.  The  paperwork  is  the  biggest  hurdle.  You  should  jointly  identify  a  local  settlement  company.  They  will  be  the  ones  actually  filing  the  paperwork.  They  have  lawyers.  They  will  check  the  county  records  office  for  existing  liens,  plats,  mortgages  and  address  all  the  issues.  They  can  send  the  proper  paperwork  to  the  existing  mortgage  companies  and  arrange  for  mortgage  insurance.  The  cost  will  be  the  same  regardless  of  the  presence  of  real  estate  agents  and  other  lawyers.    When  they  say  a  lawyer  is  required,  it  is  only  because  of  the  paperwork.
87157	Save  yourself  a  lot  of  trouble  you  both  agree  on  a  Real  Estate  Attorney  to  prepare  all  the  paperwork  (ie.  contract)  and  conduct  the  closing  for  or  with  the  Title  Company.  Then  you  both  split  the  normal  costs  of  the  transaction.  (Real  simple  professionally  handled  and  you  both  save  the  6%)
141032	Fool's  13  steps  to  invest  is  a  good  starting  point.  Specifically,  IFF  all  your  credit  cards  are  paid,  and  you  made  sure  you've  got  no  outstanding  liabilities  (that  also  accrues  interest),  stock  indexes  might  be  a  good  place  for  5-10  years  timeframes.  For  grad  school,  I'd  probably  look  into  cash  ISA  (or  local  equivalent  thereof)  -the  rate  of  return  is  going  to  be  lower,  but  having  it  in  a  separate  account  at  least  makes  it  mentally  "out  of  sight  -  out  of  mind",  so  you  can  make  sure  the  money's  there  WHEN  you  need  it.
364666	Fund  your  retirement  accounts  first.    Even  as  an  intern,  it  is  still  worthwhile  to  open  a  Roth  IRA  and  start  contributing  to  it.  See  my  answer  to  a  similar  question:  Best  way  to  start  investing,  for  a  young  person  just  starting  their  career?
335436	If  I  may  echo  the  Roth  comment  -  The  Roth  is  a  tax  designation,  not  an  end  investment,  so  you  still  need  to  research  and  decide  what's  appropriate.  I  recommend  the  Roth  for  the  long  term  investments,  but  keep  in  mind,  even  if  you  feel  you  may  need  to  tap  the  Roth  sooner  than  later,  all  deposits  may  be  withdrawn  at  any  time  with  no  tax  or  penalty.  Roth  is  great  to  store  the  emergency  money  for  many  if  they  aren't  100%  sure  they  have  enough  cash  to  save  for  retirement.  As  you  get  further  along,  and  see  that  you  don't  need  it,  change  how  it's  invested  to  longer  term,  a  mix  of  stocks  (I  prefer  ETFs  that  mimic  the  S&P)
480402	Your  attitude  is  great,  but  be  careful  to  temper  your  (awesome)  ambition  with  a  dose  of  reality.    Saving  is  investing  is  great,  the  earlier  the  better,  and  seeing  retirement  at  a  young  age  with  smooth  lots  of  life's  troubles;  saving  is  smart  and  we  all  know  it.  But  as  a  college  junior,  be  honest  with  yourself.    Don't  you  want  to  screw  around  and  play  with  some  of  that  money?    Your  first  time  with  real  income,  don't  you  want  to  blow  it  on  a  big  TV,  vacation,  or  computer?  Budget  out  those  items  with  realistic  costs.    See  the  pros  and  cons  of  spending  that  money  keeping  in  mind  the  opportunity  cost.    For  example,  when  I  was  in  college,  getting  a  new  laptop  for  $2000  (!)  was  easily  more  important  to  me  than  retirement.    I  don't  regret  that.    I  do  regret  buying  my  new  truck  too  soon  and  borrowing  money  to  do  it.    These  are  judgment  calls.  Here  is  the  classic  recipe:  Adjust  the  numbers  or  businesses  to  your  personal  preferences.    I  threw  out  suggestions  so  you  can  research  them  and  get  an  idea  of  what  to  compare.  And  most  importantly  of  all.    DO  NOT  GET  INTO  CREDIT  CARD  DEBT.    Use  credit  if  you  wish,  but  do  not  carry  a  balance.
474896	On  the  one  hand,  it's  a  great  idea  to  open  a  Roth  IRA  now,  once  you've  got  the  cash  to  contribute.  It's  a  tax  designation  sounds  like  it  would  fit  your  meager  earnings  this  year.  The  main  reason  to  open  one  now  rather  than  later  is  that  some  types  of  withdrawls  require  the  account  be  aged  5  years.  But  you  can  also  withdraw  the  amount  you've  contributed  tax  free  any  time.  Student  loans  right  now  are  pricey,  so  if  you're  carrying  a  balance  at  say  6.8  percent  fixed  you  should  pay  that  down  ASAP.  Beyond  that,  I'd  keep  the  rest  liquid  for  now.  Having  that  kind  of  liquid  cash  is  extremely  reassuring,  and  many  of  the  biggest  returns  on  investment  are  going  to  be  in  your  personal  life.  More  fuel  efficient  vehicles,  energy  efficient  appliances,  computer  backups,  chest  freezers  and  bulk  meat  purchases,  etc.    One  example  I  see  every  six  months  is  car  insurance:  I  can  pay  for  six  months  in  full  or  I  can  pay  a  smaller  monthly  bill  plus  a  small  fee.  That  fee  is  well  above  current  market  rates.  You  see  this  everywhere;  people  searching  for  lower  minimum  payments  rather  than  lower  total  costs.  Save  your  money  up  and  be  the  smart  buyer.  It's  too  damn  expensive  to  be  broke.
406036	Convenience,  and  of  course  money.  In  case  of  an  event,  you'll  have  to  spend  the  full  worth  of  money  to  fix/replace,  while  if  you're  insured  -  you  get  the  insurance  to  pay  for  it.  It  is  up  to  you  to  decide,  if  the  money  saved  on  the  lower  premiums  worth  the  risk  of  paying  much  more  in  case  of  an  event.  Of  course,  the  cheaper  the  car  the  more  it  makes  sense  not  to  pay  the  premiums.  Many  people  do  that.  Regarding  the  bargaining  power,  I  actually  think  that  you  would  pay  less  if  it  is  not  going  through  insurance  than  the  bill  the  insurance  pays.  I  fixed  a  nasty  dent  for  like  $300    at  one  shop,  while  at  the  other  they  said  "It's  $1200,  but  what  do  you  care,  your  insurance  will  cover  it"  (I  had  $500  deductible,  so  in  the  end  it  was  cheaper  for  me  to  pay  $300  without  the  insurance  at  all).
33914	As  you  suspected,  there  is  more  than  just  car  replacement  taken  care  of  by  insurance  (some  of  them  are  pointed  out  in  Chad's  story:
157630	You  lose  your  agent  services.  When  my  wife  wrecked  our  car  3  years  ago  our  agent  took  care  of  everything.    He  got  us  a  rental  car,  made  the  arrangements  to  get  it  fixed,  checked  in  to  see  how  we  were  doing,  and  even  helped  us  set  up  a  second  opinion  on  my  wifes  wrist  surgery.    The  accident  was  ruled  the  fault  of  the  uninsured  driver  who  decided  to  take  off  through  the  red  light.    But  our  insurance  was  the  one  that  covered  it  all  total  expenses  over  80k.    We  would  have  had  to  eat  most  of  those  with  out  full  coverage.      Most  everything  was  set  up  (our  rental  car,  estimates  on  repair,  even  her  inital  consutation  with  the  surgeon)  before  the  investigator  had  filed  her  report.  Our  agents  first  question  was  is  everyone  ok.  His  second  was  what  can  i  do  to  help?  He  never  asked  us  what  happened  and  was  always  ahead  of  our  needs  in  dealing  with  it.      If  these  things  are  not  important  to  you,  you  can  probably  save  quite  a  bit  of  money  self  insuring.    But  if  you  are  in  an  accident  and  unable  to  do  them  yourself,  do  you  have  someone  to  do  it  for  you?    Do  you  trust  them  to  handle  your  business  and  are  you  willing  to  saddle  them  with  the  responsibility  of  dealing  with  it?    To  me  insurance  is  less  about  me  and  more  about  my  family.    It  was  nice  that  my  agent  did  all  of  that  for  me.    I  would  have  been  willing  to  do  it  myself  though.    But  I  am  glad  to  know  he  is  there  for  my  wife  if  something  happens  to  me.
434749	You're  trading  a  fixed  liability  for  an  unknown  liability.  When  I  graduated  from  college,  I  bought  a  nice  used  car.  Two  days  later,  a  deer  came  out  of  nowhere,  and  I  hit  it  going  70  mph  on  a  highway.  The  damage?  $4,500.  If  I  didn't  have  comprehensive  insurance,  that  would  have  been  a  real  hit  to  me  financially.  For  me,  I'd  rather  just  pay  the  modest  cost  for  the  comprehensive.
446714	If  you  can  afford  to  replace  your  car,  it  is  more  cost  effective,  on  average  and  over  time,  not  to  carry  comprehensive  and  collision  insurance.  The  insurance  companies  do  make  a  profit,  after  all.  However,  you  may  be  able  to  worry  less  ("What  if  someone  steals  my  car  if  I  park  here?")  with  the  insurance,  and  you  have  the  knowledge  the  you  won't  have  to  spend  your  own  money  on  a  new  car  if  something  happens  to  this  one,  which  may  help  with  financial  planning.
147837	One  way  to  look  at  insurance  is  that  it  replaces  an  unpredictable  expenses  with  a  predictable  fees.  That  is,  you  pay  a  set  monthly  amount  ("premium")  instead  of  the  sudden  costs  associated  with  a  collision  or  other  covered  event.  Insurance  works  as  a  business,  which  means  they  intend  to  make  a  substantial  profit  for  providing  that  service.  They  put  a  lot  of  effort  in  to  measuring  probabilities,  and  carefully  set  the  premiums  to  get  make  a  steady  profit*.  The  odds  are  in  their  favor.  You  have  to  ask  yourself:  if  X  happened  tomorrow,  how  would  I  feel  about  the  financial  impact?  Also,  how  much  will  it  cost  me  to  buy  insurance  to  cover  X?  If  you  have  a  lot  of  savings,  plenty  of  available  credit,  a  bright  financial  future,  and  you  take  the  bus  to  work  anyway,  then  totaling  your  car  may  not  be  a  big  deal,  money  wise.  Skip  the  insurance.  If  you  have  no  savings,  plenty  of  debt,  little  prospects  for  that  improving,  and  you  depend  on  your  car  to  get  to  work  just  so  you  can  pay  what  you  already  owe,  then  totaling  your  car  would  probably  be  a  big  problem  for  you.  Stick  with  insurance.  There  is  a  middle  ground.  You  can  adjust  your  deductible.  Raise  it  as  high  as  you  can  comfortably  handle.  You  cover  the  small  stuff  out  of  pocket,  and  save  the  insurance  for  the  big  ticket  items.  *Insurance  companies  also  invest  the  money  they  take  as  premiums,  until  they  pay  out  a  claim.  That's  not  relevant  to  this  discussion,  though.
69495	Here's  what  you  do  without,  on  the  negative  side,  just  for  balance:  A  bill:  When  I  last  had  comprehensive  insurance,  it  cost  something  like  3-4%  of  the  value  of  the  car  per  annum.    (Obviously  ymmv  enormously  but  I  think  that's  somewhere  near  the  middle  of  the  range  and  I'm  not  especially  risky.)    So,  compared  to  the  total  depreciation  and  running  costs  of  the  car,  it's  actually  fairly  substantial.    Over  the  say  10  years  I  might  keep  that  car,  it  adds  up  to  a  fair  slice  of  what  it  will  take  to  buy  a  replacement.  Financial  crisis  costs:  I  don't  know  about  you,  but  my  insurance  went  up  something  like  30%  in  recent  years,  despite  the  value-insured  and  the  risk  going  down,  said  by  the  insurer  to  be  due  to  market  turmoil.    So,  at  least  hundreds  of  dollars  is  just  kind  of  frictional  loss,  and  I'd  rather  not  pay  it.  Wrangling  with  the  insurer:  if  you  have  insurance  and  a  loss,  you  have  to  persuade  them  to  pay  out,  perhaps  document  the  original  conditions  or  the  fault,  perhaps  argue  about  whether  their  payment  is  fair.    I've  done  this  for  small  (non-automotive)  claims,  and  it  added  up  to  more  hassle  than  the  incident  itself.    Obviously  all  insurers  will  claim  they're  friendly  to  deal  with  but  until  you  actually  have  a  big  claim  you  never  know.  Moral  hazard:  I  know  I'm  solely  responsible  for  not  having  my  car  crashed  or  stolen.    Somehow  that  just  feels  better.  Free  riders:  I've  seen  people  "fudge"  their  insurance  claims  so  that  things  that  shouldn't  have  been  covered  were  claimed  to  be.    You  might  have  too.    Buy  insurance  and  you're  paying  for  them.  Choice:  Insurers  are  typically  going  to  make  the  decision  for  you  about  whether  a  claim  is  repairable  or  not,  and  in  my  experience  are  reluctant  or  refuse  to  just  give  you  the  cash  amount  of  the  claim.  (See  also,  moral  hazard.)    Do  it  yourself  and  you  can  choose  whether  to  live  with  it,  make  a  smaller  or  larger  repair,  or  replace  the  whole  vehicle  with  a  second  hand  one  or  a  brand  new  one,  or  indeed  perhaps  do  without  a  vehicle.  A  distraction:  Hopefully  by  the  time  you've  been  working  for  a  while,  a  vehicle  is  not  a  really  large  fraction  of  your  net  worth.    If  you  lose  10%  of  your  net  worth  it's  not  really  nice  but  -  well,  you  could  easily  have  lost  that  off  the  value  of  your  house  or  your  retirement  portfolio  in  recent  years.    What  you  actually  need  to  insure  is  genuinely  serious  risks  that  would  seriously  change  your  life  if  they  were  lost,  such  as  your  ability  to  work.    For  about  the  same  cost  as  insuring  a  $x  car,  you  can  insure  against  $x  income  every  year  for  the  rest  of  your  life,  and  I  think  it's  far  more  important.  If  I  have  a  write-off  accident  but  walk  away  I'll  be  perfectly  happy.  And,  obviously,  liability  insurance  is  important,  because  being  hit  for  $millions  of  liabilities  could  also  have  a  serious  impact.      Coverage  for  mechanical  failures:  If  your  8yo  car  needs  a  new  transmission,  insurance  isn't  going  to  help,  yet  it  may  cost  more  than  the  typical  minor  collision.    Save  the  money  yourself  and  you  can  manage  those  costs  out  of  the  same  bucket.  Flexibility:  If  you  save  up  to  replace  your  car,  but  some  other  crisis  occurs,  you  can  choose  to  put  the  money  towards  that.    If  you  have  car  insurance  but  you  have  a  family  medical  thing  it's  no  help.  I  think  the  bottom  line  is:  insure  against  costs  you  couldn't  cope  with  by  yourself.    There  are  people  who  need  a  car  but  can  just  barely  afford  it,  but  if  you're  fortunate  enough  not  to  be  in  that  case  you  don't  really  need  comprehensive  insurance.
281040	Insurance  is  to  mitigate  risk  you  can't  handle  yourself.    (All  insurance,  not  just  car  insurance.)    The  expected  value  of  the  insurance  will  always  cost  more  than  the  expected  value  of  your  loss,  that's  how  the  insurance  company  makes  money.    But  sometimes  the  known  fixed  cost  is  better  for  your  ability  to  sleep  at  night  than  the  unknown  (though  likely  lower)  variable  cost.  If  you  were  suddenly  hit  with  a  bill  the  size  of  your  car  tomorrow,  would  you  be  ok?    If  so,  then  you  can  handle  the  risk  yourself  and  don't  need  insurance.    If  not,  then  you  need  the  insurance.  The  insurance  company  sells  thousands  of  policies  and  it's  much  easier  to  predict  the  number  out  of  1000  people  that  will  get  in  an  accident  tomorrow  than  the  chance  that  you  specifically  will  get  in  an  accident  tomorrow.    So  they  can  manage  the  risk  by  making  a  small  amount  of  money  from  999/1000  people  and  buying  the  other  guy  a  new  car.
495977	As  others  have  pointed  out,  it's  all  about  a  fixed,  small  cost  versus  the  potential  of  a  large  cost.  If  you  have  insurance,  you  know  you  will  pay  a  fixed  amount  per  month.  There  is  a  100%  probability  that  you  will  have  to  pay  this  premium.  If  you  don't  have  insurance,  there  is  a  large  chance  that  you  will  have  no  cost  in  any  given  month,  and  a  small  chance  that  you  will  have  a  large  cost.  Like  my  home-owners  insurance  costs  me  about  $50  per  month.  If  I  didn't  have  insurance  and  my  house  burned  down,  I  would  be  out  something  like  $100,000.  What's  the  chance  that  my  house  will  burn  down  this  month?  Very  small.  But  I'd  rather  pay  $50  and  not  have  to  worry  about  it.  On  the  other  hand,  I  just  bought  a  filing  cabinet  for  $160  and  the  store  offered  me  an  "extended  warranty"  for  something  like  $20  a  year.  What's  the  probability  that  some  accident  will  happen  that  damages  my  filing  cabinet?  Pretty  small.  Even  if  it  did,  I  think  I  could  handle  shelling  out  $160.  I  can  imagine  my  stomach  in  knots  and  lying  awake  at  nights  worrying  about  the  possibility  of  losing  $100,000  or  finding  myself  homeless.  I  can't  imagine  lying  awake  at  nights  worrying  about  losing  $160  or  being  force  to  stuff  my  files  under  the  bed.  I'll  take  my  chances.  When  I  was  young  and  had  even  less  money  than  I  have  now,  I  bought  cars  that  cost  me  a  thousand  dollars  or.  Even  poor  as  I  was,  I  knew  that  if  the  car  was  totaled  I  could  dig  up  the  cash  to  buy  another.  It  wasn't  worth  paying  the  insurance  premium.  These  days  I'm  driving  a  car  that  cost  me  $6,000.  I  have  collision  and  comprehensive  insurance,  but  I  think  it's  debatable.  I  bought  the  car  with  cash  to  begin  with,  and  if  I  had  to  I  could  scrape  up  the  cash  to  replace  it.  Especially  considering  that  my  last  payment  for  my  daughter's  college  tuition  is  due  next  month  and  then  that  expense  is  gone.  :-)
328477	Don't  do  it  until  you  have  educated  yourself  enough  to  know  what  you  are  doing.  I  hope  you  won't  take  this  personally,  but  given  that  you  are  wandering  around  asking  random  strangers  on  the  Internet  how  to  "get  into  investing,"  I  feel  safe  in  concluding  that  you  are  by  no  means  a  sophisticated  enough  investor  to  be  choosing  individual  investments,  nor  should  you  be  trusting  financial  advisors  to  choose  investments  for  you.  Believe  me,  they  do  not  have  your  interests  at  heart.  I  usually  advise  people  in  your  position  to  start  by  reading  one  book:  A  Random  Walk  Down  Wall  Street  by  Burton  Malkiel.  Once  you've  read  the  book  by  Malkiel  you'll  understand  that  the  best  strategy  for  all  but  the  most  sophisticated  investors  is  to  buy  an  index  fund,  which  simply  purchases  a  portfolio  of  ALL  available  stocks  without  trying  to  pick  winners  and  losers.  The  best  index  funds  are  at  Vanguard  (there  is  also  a  Vanguard  site  for  non-US  residents).  Vanguard  is  one  of  the  very,  very,  very  few  honest  players  in  the  business.  Unlike  almost  any  other  mutual  fund,  Vanguard  is  owned  by  its  investors,  so  it  has  no  profit  motive.  They  never  try  to  pick  individual  stocks,  so  they  don't  have  to  pay  fancy  high-priced  analysts  to  pick  stocks.  If  you  find  it  impossible  to  open  a  Vanguard  account  from  wherever  you're  living,  find  a  local  brokerage  account  that  will  allow  you  to  invest  in  the  US  stock  market.  Many  Vanguard  mutual  funds  are  available  as  ETFs  which  means  that  you  buy  and  sell  them  just  like  any  other  stock  on  the  US  market,  which  should  be  easy  to  do  from  any  reasonably  civilized  place.
85373	If  you  plan  to  keep  this  asset  for  ten  years  then  you  can  take  the  deprecation  of  its  cost  over  that  time  period.  For  simplicity  lets  treat  that  as  120  monthly  payments.  So  at  a  purchase  price  of  $60,000  you  are  committing  around  $500  per  month  not  including  vehicle  maintenance.  I  typically  allocate  around  20  percent  of  the  purchase  price  of  my  vehicles  for  future  maintenance  costs.  Since  you  have  the  cash  to  purchase  this  outright  you  have  an  option  not  afforded  to  most  people.  This  adds  for  additional  consideration.  Here  is  an  example.    You  purchase  a  $60,000  car  and  put  $10,000  down.  You  finance  $50,000  at  2.84%  over  60  months.  Your  total  finance  cost  is  $53,693  if  you  do  not  miss  any  payments.  The  question  here  is  can  you  make  more  than  $3,693  on  the  $50,000  that  you  would  retain  in  this  situation  over  a  five  year  period?  I  know  that  I  most  certainly  can  and  is  an  excellent  example  of  why  I  finance  my  vehicles.  Obviously  this  all  goes  out  the  window  if  you  do  not  have  the  credit  for  top  rates.    I  have  also  negotiated  a  vehicle  maintenance  plan  with  the  dealership  at  the  time  of  my  vehicle  purchases.  Most  dealerships  offer  this  service,  the  key  here  is  negotiating.  On  my  last  truck  I  was  able  to  get  an  all  inclusive  maintenance  policy  for  72  months  for  8%  of  the  purchase  price.  Your  mileage  will  vary  with  manufacturer  and  dealership.  As  described  in  the  comments  above  it  is  never  beneficial  for  an  individual  to  lease.  You  end  up  paying  more  for  the  newer  models.  I  consider  that  to  be  a  lifestyle  choice  as  it  is  most  certainly  not  a  sound  financial  decision.
273480	This  question  has  been  asked  and  answered  before.  Financially,  owning  a  car  will  be  more  economical  than  leasing  one  in  most  cases.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  leasing  arrangements  are  designed  to  make  a  profit  for  the  leasing  company  over  and  above  the  value  of  the  car.  A  leasing  company  that  does  not  profit  off  their  customers  will  not  be  in  business  for  long.  This  is  a  zero-sum  game  and  the  leasing  customer  is  the  loser.  The  lion's  share  of  the  customer  losses  are  in  maintenance  and  in  the  event  of  an  accident  or  other  damage.  In  both  cases,  leasing  arrangements  are  designed  to  make  a  large  profit  for  the  owner.  The  average  customer  assumes  they  will  never  get  into  an  accident  and  they  underestimate  the  losses  they  will  take  on  the  maintenance.  For  example,  if  both  oxygen  sensors  need  to  be  replaced  and  it  would  have  cost  you  $800  to  replace  them  yourself,  but  the  leasing  company  charges  you  $1200,  then  BOOM!  you  just  lost  $400.  If  the  car  is  totaled,  the  customer  will  lose  many  thousands  of  dollars.  Leasing  contracts  are  designed  to  make  money  for  the  owner,  not  the  customer.  Another  way  leasing  agents  make  money  is  on  "required  maintenance".  Most  leasing  contracts  require  the  leasor  to  perform  "required"  maintenance,  oil  changes,  tire  rotations,  etc.  Also,  with  newer  cars  manufacturers  recalls  are  common.  Those  are  required  as  well.  Nearly  nobody  does  this  maintenance  correctly.  This  gives  the  agent  the  excuse  to  charge  the  customer  thousands  of  dollars  when  the  vehicle  is  returned.  Bills  of  $4000  to  $6000  on  a  3  year  lease  for  failure  to  perform  required  maintenance  are  common.  Its  items  like  this  that  allow  the  leasing  agent  to  get  a  profit  on  what  looks  like  a  "good  deal"  when  the  customer  walked  in  the  door  3  years  previously.  The  advantage  of  leasing  is  that  it  costs  less  up  front  and  it  is  more  convenient  to  switch  to  a  different  car  because  you  don't  have  to  sell  the  car.
599159	If  history  is  any  guide,  Page’s  idealistic  impulses  could  result  in  a  vaster,  more  sprawling  company.  The  following  is  an  example  of  one  of  Page’s  idealistic  impulses  (wanting  people  to  share  spectrum)  which  could  result  in  a  vaster,  more  sprawling  company  (if  they  hadn't  been  outbid,  Google  would  have  expanded  by  buying  a  business  asset  i.e.  spectrum  which  they  didn't  need).  I've  no  experience  with  bidding.  I  don't  understand  what's  happening  at  all  An  'auction'  is  a  way  to  sell  something.  Instead  of  offering  it  for  sale  at  a  fixed  price,  you  offer  it  'to  the  highest  bidder'.  Someone  (e.g.  Google)  says,  "I'll  offer  you  [some  amount:  e.g.  a  million  dollars]  for  it."  If  no-one  else  exceeds  that  bid,  then  you  say  'sold'  and  Google  has  bought  it.  Alternatively  someone  else  comes  along  with  a  higher  bid,  "I'll  offer  you  two  million  dollars  for  it,"  in  which  case  they're  the  new  high  bidder,  and  you'll  sell  it  to  them  unless  the  process  repeats  itself  with  anyone  counter-offering  an  even  higher  bid.  See  also  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction  and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_auction  The  "Disadvantages"  section  of  this  article  alleges  (currently  without  a  citation)  that:  Despite  the  apparent  success  of  spectrum  auctions,  an  important  disadvantage  limiting  both  efficiency  and  revenues  is  demand  reduction  and  collusive  bidding.  The  information  and  flexibility  in  the  process  of  auction  can  be  used  to  reduce  auction  prices  by  tacit  collusion.  When  bidder  competition  is  weak  and  one  bidder  holds  an  apparent  advantage  to  win  the  auction  for  specific  licenses,  other  bidders  will  often  choose  not  to  the  bid  for  higher  prices,  hence  reducing  the  final  revenue  generated  by  the  auction.[citation  needed]  In  this  case,  the  auction  is  best  thought  of  as  a  negotiation  among  the  bidders,  who  agree  on  who  should  win  the  auction  for  each  discrete  bit  of  spectrum.  Google's  bid  made  that  impossible  (or,  at  least,  ensured  that  the  winning  bid  would  be  at  least  as  high  as  the  minimum  which  was  set  by  Google's  bid).
350162	At  the  time  of  the  auction  android  was  just  vaporware  but  many  companies  were  restricting  the  phones  that  they  allowed  on  their  networks  so  that  they  could  control  what  the  phones  were  being  used  for.    The  big  guys  (AT&T,  Verison,  and  Sprint)  feared  that  being  forced  to  allow  phones  that  could  do  things  they  did  not  have  control  over  would  cost  them  money(Especially  since  they  charged  for  every  little  feature  they  added).  They  also  wanted  to  prevent  their  phones  (which  they  subsidize  to  their  customers  in  to  reap  long  term  profits)  from  being  taken  to  other  networks.      Goggle  saw  the  potential  for  the  largest  chunk  of  bandwidth  available  to  the  telco's  to  be  restricted  to  services  of  one  company  and  their  strangle  hold  over  the  phones  and  services  that  were  allowed  to  use  it.    They  manuvered  the  bidding  to  ensure  that  this  did  not  happen.    There  are  many  who  believe  that  Verison  bought  the  spectrum  more  to  prevent  anyone  from  competeing  with  them  than  because  they  actually  wanted  to  use  it.    But  at  least  they  are  forced  to  allow  other  parties  in  to  compete  even  if  it  is  on  their  playground.
33987	Assuming  I  don't  need  any  other  new  lines  of  credit,  can  I  get  pre-qualified  repeatedly  (and  with  different  banks)  with  impunity?  Yes,  but  only  for  a  limited  period.  FICO  says:  Hard  inquiries  are  inquiries  where  a  potential  lender  is  reviewing  your  credit  because  you've  applied  for  credit  with  them.  These  include  credit  checks  when  you've  applied  for  an  auto  loan,  mortgage  or  credit  card.  Each  of  these  types  of  credit  checks  count  as  a  single  inquiry.  One  exception  occurs  when  you  are  "rate  shopping".  That's  a  smart  thing  to  do,  and  your  FICO  score  considers  all  inquiries  within  a  45  period  for  a  mortgage,  an  auto  loan  or  a  student  loan  as  a  single  inquiry.  However  for  your  situation,  since  you  won't  be  getting  a  loan  for  several  months,  getting  inquiries  more  than  45  days  apart  will  each  count  as  a  separate  inquiry.
230297	tl;dr:  Your  best  course  of  action  is  probably  to  do  a  soft  pull  (check  your  own  credit)  and  provide  that  to  the  lender  for  an  unofficial  pre-approval  to  get  the  ball  rolling.  The  long  of  it:  The  loan  officer  is  mostly  correct,  and  I  have  recent  personal  evidence  that  corroborates  that.  A  few  months  ago  I  looked  into  refinancing  a  mortgage  on  a  rental  property,  and  I  allowed  3  different  lenders  to  do  a  hard  inquiry  within  1  week  of  each  other.  I  saw  all  3  inquires  appear  on  reports  from  each  of  the  3  credit  bureaus  (EQ/TU/EX),  but  it  was  only  counted  as  a  single  inquiry  in  my  score  factors.  But  as  you  have  suggested,  this  breaks  down  when  you  know  that  you  won't  be  purchasing  right  away,  because  then  you  will  have  multiple  hard  inquiries  at  least  a  few  months  apart  which  could  possibly  have  a  (minor)  negative  impact  on  your  score.  However  minor  it  is,  you  might  as  well  try  to  avoid  it  if  you  can.  I  have  played  around  with  the  simulator  on  myfico.com,  and  have  found  inquiries  to  have  the  following  effect  on  your  credit  score  using  the  FICO  Score  8  model:  With  one  inquiry,  your  scores  will  adjust  as  such:  Two  inquiries:  Three  inquiries:  Here's  a  helpful  quote  from  the  simulator  notes:  "Credit  inquiries  remain  on  your  credit  report  for  2  years,  but  FICO  Scores  only  consider  credit  inquiries  from  the  past  12  months."  Of  course,  take  that  with  a  grain  of  salt,  as  myfico  provides  the  following  disclaimer:  The  Simulator  is  provided  for  informational  purposes  only  and  should  not  be  expected  to  provide  accurate  predictions  in  all  situations.  Consequently,  we  make  no  promise  or  guarantee  with  regard  to  the  Simulator.  Having  said  all  that,  in  your  situation,  if  you  know  with  certainty  that  you  will  not  be  purchasing  right  away,  then  I  would  recommend  doing  a  soft  pull  to  get  your  scores  now  (check  your  credit  yourself),  and  see  if  the  lender  will  use  those  numbers  to  estimate  your  pre-approval.  One  possible  downside  of  this  is  the  lender  may  not  be  able  to  give  you  an  official  pre-approval  letter  based  on  your  soft  pull.  I  wouldn't  worry  too  much  about  that  though  since  if  you  are  suddenly  ready  to  purchase  you  could  just  tell  them  to  go  ahead  with  the  hard  pull  so  they  can  furnish  an  official  pre-approval  letter.  Interesting  Side  Note:  Last  month  I  applied  for  a  new  mortgage  and  my  score  was  about  40  points  lower  than  it  was  3  months  ago.  At  first  I  thought  this  was  due  to  my  recent  refinancing  of  property  and  the  credit  inquiries  that  came  along  with  it,  but  then  I  noticed  that  one  of  my  business  credit  cards  had  recently  accrued  a  high  balance.  It  just  so  happens  that  this  particular  business  CC  reports  to  my  personal  credit  report  (most  likely  in  error  but  I  never  bothered  to  do  anything  about  it).  I  immediately  paid  that  CC  off  in  full,  and  checked  my  credit  20  days  later  after  it  had  reported,  and  my  score  shot  back  up  by  over  30  points.  I  called  my  lender  and  instructed  them  to  re-pull  my  credit  (hard  inquiry),  which  they  did,  and  this  pushed  me  back  up  into  the  best  mortgage  rate  category.  Yes,  I  purposely  requested  another  hard  pull,  but  it  shouldn't  affect  my  score  since  it  was  within  45  days,  and  that  maneuver  will  save  me  thousands  in  the  long  run.
477143	The  main  reason,  as  far  as  I  can  see,  is  that  the  dividends  are  payments  with  which  the  shareholders  may  do  what  they  want.  Capital  that  the  company  has  no  use  for  does  not  make  a  significant  positive  return  on  investment,  as  you  pointed  out,  yes  the  company  could  accrue  interest,  but  that  is  not  going  to  make  the  company  large  sums  of  cash.  While  the  company  may  be  great  at  making  shoes  -  maybe  even  the  best  in  the  world  -  doesn't  mean  they  are  good  investors.  Sure  they  could  dabble  at  using  their  capital  to  invest  in  other  equities,  but  they  don't,  because  they  just  want  to  focus  on  making  shoes.  If  the  dividend  goes  to  the  investors,  they  can  do  what  they  wish,  be  it  reinvest  in  the  company,  or  invest  elsewhere.  Other  companies  that  may  make  good  use  of  the  capital,  and  create  significant  returns  on  it  are  one  such  example.  That  is  the  rational  answer,  beyond  that,  one  of  the  main  reasons  is  that  people  like  the  feeling  of  receiving  dividends  -  it  might  not  be  the  answer  you  are  looking  for,  but  many  people  prefer  companies  that  pay  dividends  for  no  rational  reason  over  companies  which  grow  their  asset  value.
92516	First,  you  need  to  understand  that  not    every  investor's  goals  are  the  same.  Some  investors  are  investing  for  income.  They  want  to  invest  in  a  profitable  company  and  use  the  profit  from  the  company  as  income.  If  that  investor  invests  only  in  stocks  that  do  not  pay  a  dividend,  the  only  way  he  can  realize  income  is  to  sell  his  investment.  But  he  can  invest  in  companies  that  pay  a  regular  dividend  and  use  that  income  while  keeping  his  investment  intact.    Imagine  this:  Let's  say  I  own  a  profitable  company,  and  I  offer  to  sell  you  part  ownership  in  that  company.  However,  I  tell  you  this  upfront:  no  matter  how  much  profit  our  company  makes,  you  will  never  get  a  penny  from  me.  You  will  be  getting  a  stock  certificate  -  a  piece  of  paper  -  and  that's  it.  You  can  watch  the  company  grow,  and  you  can  tell  yourself  you  own  it,  but  the  only  way  you  will  personally  benefit  from  your  investment  would  be  to  sell  your  piece  to  someone  else,  who  would  also  never  see  a  penny  in  profit.  Does  that  sound  like  a  good  investment?  The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  stocks  in  companies  that  do  not  distribute  dividends  do  have  value,  but  this  value  is  largely  based  on  the  potential  of  profits/dividends  at  some  point  in  the  future.  If  a  company  vows  never  ever  to  pay  dividends,  why  would  anyone  invest?    An  investment  would  be  more  of  a  donation  (like  Kickstarter)  at  that  point.    A  company  that  pays  dividends  is  possibly  past  their  growth  stage.  That  doesn't  necessarily  mean  that  they  have  stopped  growing  altogether,  but  remember  that  an  expansion  project  for  any  company  does  not  automatically  yield  a  good  result.  If  a  company  does  not  have  a  good  opportunity  currently  for  a  growth  project,  I  as  an  investor  would  rather  get  a  dividend  than  have  the  company  blow  all  the  profit  on  a  ill-fated  gamble.
401753	Actually,  share  holder  value  is  is  better  maximised  by  borrowing,  and  paying  dividends  is  fairly  irrelevant  but  a  natural  phase  on  a  mature  and  stable  company.  Company  finance  is  generally  a  balance  between  borrowing,  and  money  raised  from  shares.  It  should  be  self  evident  with  a  little  thought  that  if  not  now,  then  in  the  future,  a  company  should  be  able  to  create  earnings  in  excess  of  the  cost  of  borrowing,  or  it's  not  a  very  valuable  company  to  invest  in!  In  fact  what's  the  point  of  borrowing  if  the  cost  of  the  interest  is  greater  than  whatever  wealth  is  being  generated?  The  important  thing  about  this  is  that  money  raised  from  shares  is  more  expensive  than  borrowing.  If  a  company  doesn't  pay  dividends,  and  its  share  price  goes  up  because  of  the  increasing  value  of  the  business,  and  in  your  example  the  company  is  not  borrowing  more  because  of  this,  then  the  proportion  of  the  value  of  the  company  that  is  based  on  the  borrowing  goes  down.  So,  this  means  a  higher  and  higher  proportion  of  the  finance  of  a  company  is  provided  by  the  more  expensive  share  holders  than  the  less  expensive  borrowing,  and  thus  the  company  is  actually  providing  LESS  value  to  share  holders  than  it  might.  Of  course,  if  a  company  doesn't  pay  a  dividend  AND  borrows  more,  this  is  not  true,  but  that's  not  the  scenario  in  your  question,  and  generally  mature  companies  with  mature  earnings  may  as  well  pay  dividends  as  they  aren't  on  a  massive  expansion  drive  in  the  same  way.  Now,  this  relative  expense  of  share  holders  and  borrowing  is  MORE  true  for  a  mature  company  with  stable  earnings,  as  they  are  less  of  a  risk  and  can  borrow  at  more  favourable  rates,  AND  such  a  company  is  LIKELY  to  be  expanding  less  rapidly  than  a  small  new  innovative  company,  so  for  both  these  reasons  returning  money  to  share  holders  and  borrowing  (or  maintaining  existing  lending  facilities)  maintains  a  relatively  more  efficient  financing  ratio.  Of  course  all  this  means  that  in  theory,  a  company  should  be  more  efficient  if  it  has  no  share  holders  at  all  and  borrows  ALL  of  the  money  it  needs.  Yes.  In  practise  though,  lenders  aren't  so  keen  on  that  scenario,  they  would  rather  have  shareholders  sharing  the  risk,  and  lending  a  less  than  100%  proportion  of  the  total  of  a  companies  finance  means  they  are  much  more  likely  to  get  their  money  back  if  things  go  horribly  wrong.  To  take  a  small  start  up  company  by  comparison,  lenders  will  be  leary  of  lending  at  all,  and  will  certainly  impose  high  rates  if  they  do,  or  ask  for  guarantors,  or  demand  security  (and  security  is  only  available  if  there  is  other  investment  besides  the  loan).  So  this  is  why  a  small  start  up  is  likely  to  be  much  more  heavily  or  exclusively  funded  by  share  holders.  Also  the  start  up  is  likely  not  to  pay  a  dividend,  because  for  a  start  it's  probably  not  making  any  profit,  but  even  if  it  is  and  could  pay  a  dividend,  in  this  situation  borrowing  is  unavailable  or  very  expensive  and  this  is  a  rapidly  growing  business  that  wants  to  keep  its  hands  on  all  the  cash  it  can  to  accelerate  itself.  Once  it  starts  making  money  of  course  a  start  up  is  on  its  way  to  making  the  transition,  it  becomes  able  to  borrow  money  at  sensible  rates,  it  becomes  bigger  and  more  valuable  on  the  back  of  the  borrowing.  Another  important  point  is  that  dividend  income  is  more  stable,  at  least  for  the  mature  companies  with  stable  earnings  of  your  scenario,  and  investors  like  stability.  If  all  the  income  from  a  portfolio  has  to  be  generated  by  sales,  what  happens  when  there  is  a  market  crash?  Suddenly  the  investor  has  to  pay,  where  as  with  dividends,  the  company  pays,  at  least  for  a  while.  If  a  company's  earnings  are  hit  by  market  conditions  of  course  it's  likely  the  dividend  will  eventually  be  cut,  but  short  term  volatility  should  be  largely  eliminated.
578261	It  comes  down  to  the  practical  value  of  paying  dividends.  The  investor  can  continually  receive  a  stream  of  income  without  selling  shares  of  the  stock.  If  the  stock  did  not  pay  a  dividend  and  wanted  continual  income,  the  investor  would  have  to  continually  sell  shares  to  gain  this  stream  of  income,  incurring  transaction  costs  and  increased  time  and  effort  involved  with  making  these  transactions.
247895	The  real  value  of  a  share  of  stock  is  the  current  cash  value  of  all  dividends  the  owner  will  receive,  plus  the  current  cash  value  of  the  final  liquidation  if  any.    Since  people  with  different  needs  may  judge  the  current  cash  value  of  an  income  stream  differently,  there  would  be  a  market  basis  for  people  to  buy  and  sell  stocks  even  if  everyone  could  predict  all  future  payouts  perfectly.  If  shareholders  knew  that  a  company  wouldn't  pay  any  dividends  until  it  was  liquidated  in  the  year  2066,  whereupon  it  would  pay  $2000/share,  then  each  share  would  in  2016  effectively  be  a  fifty-year  zero-coupon  bond  with  a  $2000  maturity  value.    While  some  investors  would  be  willing  to  trade  in  such  an  instrument,  the  amount  of  money  a  company  could  charge  for  such  an  instrument  would  be  far  lower  than  the  money  it  could  charge  for  one  with  payouts  that  were  more  evenly  distributed  through  time.  Since  the  founders  of  most  companies  want  their  companies  to  be  around  for  a  long  time,  that  would  mean  that  shareholders  would  have  no  expectation  of  their  shares  ever  yielding  anything  of  value  within  any  foreseeable  timeframe.    Even  those  who  would  be  more  interested  in  share-price  appreciation  than  dividends  wouldn't  be  able  to  see  share  prices  rise  if  there  wasn't  any  likelihood  of  the  stock  being  bought  by  someone  who  wanted  the  dividends.
506447	Firstly,  investors  love  dividend  paying  company  as  dividends  are  proof  of  making  profit  (sometimes  dividend  can  be  paid  out  of  past  profits  too)      Secondly,  investor  cash  in  hand  is  better  than  potential  earnings  by  the  company  by  way  of  interest.  Investor  feels  good  to  redeploy  received  cash  (dividend)  on  their  own      Thirdly,  in  some  countries  dividend  are  tax  free  income  as  tax  on  dividends  has  already  been  paid.  As  average  tax  on  dividend  is  lower  than  maximum  marginal  tax;  for  some  investor  it  generates  extra  post  tax  income      Fourthly,  dividend  pay  out  ratio  of  most  companies  don't  exceed  30%  of  available  fund  for  paying  (surplus  cash)  so  it  is  seen  as  best  of  both  the  world  Lastly,  I  trust  by  instinct  a  regular  dividend  paying  company  more  than  not  paying  one  in  same  sector  of  industry
133522	Paying  out  dividends  and  financing  new  projects  with  debt  also  lessens  the  agency  problem.  The  consequences  of  a  failed  project  are  greater  when  debt  is  used,  so  the  manager  now  has  a  greater  incentive  to  see  that  the  project  is  a  success.  This,  in  addition  to  the  paid  divided  is  a  benefit  to  the  shareholder.  If  equity  wasn't  paid  out  and  instead  used  for  the  project  then  the  manager  may  not  be  so  interested  in  its  success.  And  if  it's  a  failure  then  the  shareholders  are  worse  off.
426705	Okay  so  I  am  going  to  break  this  answer  into  a  couple  sections:  Okay  so  first  things  first.  Did  you  get  a  good  deal?  This  is  challenging  to  answer  for  a  number  of  reasons.  First,  a  good  deal  is  relative  to  the  buyers  goals.  If  you're  attempting  to  buy  an  asset  that  provides  passive  income  then  maybe  you  met  your  goal  and  got  a  good  deal.  If  you're  attempting  to  buy  an  asset  that  provides  long  term  growth,  and  you  purchased  above  market  (I'm  speculating  of  course)  then  you  may  have  made  a  bad  deal.  So  how  do  you  determine  if  you  got  a  good  deal?  Does  your  "Gross  Rental  Multiplier"  equal  that  or  is  less  than  that  of  the  average  GRM  in  your  area.  The  lower  the  better.    So  how  do  you  use  the  GRM  to  determine  if  you're  getting  a  good  deal?  Divide  your  purchase  price  by  the  average  city  (or  area)  GRM  and  that  will  tell  you  what  you  should  be  getting  annually  in  rent.    You  can  also  use  the  GRM  to  determine  if  a  future  purchase  is  over  or  under  priced.  Just  replace  purchase  price  with  asking  price.    Alright,  so  these  are  the  tools  you  can  use  to  decide  if  you  made  a  bad  business  deal  or  not.  There  are  many  ways  to  skin  a  cat  so  to  speak.  These  are  the  tools  I  use  BEFORE  I  purchase  a  home.  Many  people  are  penny  wise  and  pound  foolish.  Take  your  time  when  making  large  purchases.  It's  OKAY  to  say  PASS.    Okay  next  thing  is  this  new  purchase  you're  looking  at.  The  number  one  rule  when  working  a  franchise  is  you  don't  open  a  second  store  until  you  have  a  perfect  working  model  to  go  off  of.  If  you've  never  had  to  file  a  tax  return  for  your  current  rental.  Then  you  need  to  wait.  If  you've  never  read  your  local  and  state  rental  laws.  Then  you  need  to  WAIT.  If  you've  never  had  to  leave  an  event  early,  wake  up  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  or  get  a  text  while  you're  on  a  date  from  one  of  your  tenants.  THEN  YOU  NEED  TO  WAIT.  Give  it  a  year  or  two.  Just  learn  the  unknown  about  rental  properties.  Use  your  first  as  your  test  bed.  It's  WAY  more  cheaper  then  if  you  make  a  bad  mistake  and  roll  it  over  multiple  properties.    Finally  I  will  leave  you  with  this.  No  one  on  this  site,  myself  included,  knows  everything  there  is  to  know  about  real  estate.  Anyone  that  claims  they  do,  send  their  ass  packing.  This  is  a  complex  COMPLEX  business.  There  is  always  something  to  learn  and  if  you  don't  have  the  passion  to  continue  learning  then  hand  it  off  to  someone  who  does.  There  is  tax  law,  rental  law,  city  repair  law,  contract  law  and  this  doesn't  even  include  the  stuff  that  makes  you  money,  like  knowing  how  to  leverage  low  or  no  money  down  loans.    Please  take  some  time  and  go  out  and  learn.    Good  luck!  -AR
78825	You  question  is  a  bit  scary  to  me.  You  show  $2100  rent,  and  let's  even  assume  that's  100%,  i.e.  never  a  vacancy.  (Rule  of  thumb  is  10%  vacancy.  Depending  on  area,  a  tenant  may  stay  a  year,  but  when  they  leave,  you  might  need  to  have  a  bit  of  maintenance  and  miss  2  months  rent)  You  count  the  mortgage  and  taxes,  and  are  left  with  $500/mo.  Where  is  the  list  of  ongoing  expenses?  I  suggest  you  put  that  $500/mo  into  a  separate  account  and  let  us  know  a  year  from  now  if  anything  is  left.  To  Anthony's  point.  I  agree  100%,  no  one  can  tell  you  everything  you  need  to  know.  But,  whatever  my  answer,  or  his,  other  members  with  experience  (similar  or  different)  will  add  to  this,  and  in  the  end  you'll  have  a  great  overview.  The  truth  is  that  it's  easy  for  me  to  sit  here  and  see  what  you  may  be  missing.  By  the  way,  if  you  look  at  the  'rules  of  thumb'  they  will  make  your  head  spin.  There  are  those  who  say  the  target  is  for  the  rent  to  be  2%  of  the  value  of  the  house.  But,  there  are  markets  where  this  will  never  happen.  There's  another  rule  that  says  the  expenses  (besides  mort/tax)  should  be  planned  at  50%  of  the  rent,  i.e.  you  should  put  aside  $1000/mo  for  expenses  over  the  long  term.  The  new  house  will  be  lower  of  course,  but  in  years  past  year  10  or  so,  this  number  will  start  to  look  reasonable.
361263	Cosigning  is  explicitly  a  promise  that  you  will  make  the  payments  if  the  primary  signer  can  not.  Don't  do  it  unless  you  are  able  to  handle  the  cost  and  trust  the  other  party  will  "make  you  whole"  when  they  can...  which  means  don't  do  it  for  anyone  you  would  not  lend  your  money  to,  since  it  comes  out  to  about  the  same  level  of  risk.  Having  agreed,  you're  sorta  stuck  with  your  ex-friend's  problem.  I  recommend  talking  to  a  lawyer  about  the  safest  way  get  out  of  this.  It  isn't  clear  you  can  even  sue  the  ex-friend  at  this  point.
361646	I'm  sorry  you  are  going  through  this,  but  what  you  are  dealing  with  is  exactly  is  how  cosigning  works.    It  is  among  other  reasons  why  you  should  never  cosign  a  loan  for  someone  unless  you  are  100%  prepared  to  pay  the  loan  on  their  behalf.  Unfortunately,  the  main  "benefit"  to  cosigning  a  loan  is  to  the  bank  -  they  don't  care  who  makes  payments,  only  that  someone  does.  It  is  not  in  their  interest  to  educate  purchasers  who  can  easily  get  themselves  into  the  situation  you  are  in.  What  your  options  are  depends  a  fair  bit  on  the  type  of  loan  it  is.  The  biggest  problem  is  that  normally  as  cosigner  you  cannot  force  your  friend  to  do  anything.  If  it  is  for  a  car,  your  best  bet  is  to  convince  them  to  sell  the  car  and  hopefully  recoup  more  than  the  cost  of  the  loan.  Many  workplaces  have  some  sort  of  free  service  to  provide  counseling/guidance  on  this  sort  of  thing.  Look  into  your  employee  benefits  as  you  may  have  some  free  services  there.  You  can  sue  your  friend  in  small  claims  court,  but  keep  in  mind:  It  also  depends  on  how  big  the  loan  is  relative  to  your  income.  While  it  might  feel  good  to  sue  your  friend  in  small  claims  court,  if  it's  for  $500  it  probably  isn't  worthwhile  -  but  if  your  friend  just  stopped  paying  off  their  $30k  vehicle  assuming  you  will  pay  for  it,  even  though  they  can  pay  for  it  themselves?
57211	I  am  not  sure  how  anyone  is  answering  this  unless  they  know  what  the  loan  was  for.    For  instance  if  it  is  for  a  house  you  can  put  a  lien  on  the  house.    If  it  is  for  the  car  in  most  states  you  can  take  over  ownership  of  it.      Point  being  is  that  you  need  to  go  after  the  asset.      If  there  is  no  asset  you  need  to  go  after  you  "friend".    Again  we  need  more  specifics  to  determine  the  best  course  of  action  which  could  range  from  you  suing  and  garnishing  wages  from  your  friend  to  going  to  small  claims  court.    Part  of  this  process  is  also  getting  a  hold  of  the  lending  institution.    By  letting  them  know  what  is  going  on  they  may  be  able  to  help  you  -  they  are  good  at  tracking  people  down  for  free.  Also  the  lender  may  be  able  to  give  you  options.    For  example  if  it  is  for  a  car  a  bank  may  help  you  clear  this  out  if  you  get  the  car  back  plus  penalty.    If  a  car  is  not  in  the  red  on  the  loan  and  it  is  in  good  condition  the  bank  turns  a  profit  on  the  default.    If  they  can  recover  it  for  free  they  will  be  willing  to  work  with  you.    I  worked  in  repo  when  younger  and  on  more  than  a  few  occasions  we  had  the  cosigner  helping.    It  went  down  like  this...  Co-signer  gets  pissed  like  you  and  calls  bank,  bank  works  out  a  plan  and  tells  cosigner  to  default,  cosigner  defaults,  banks  gives  cosigner  rights  to  repo  vehicle,  cosigner  helps  or  actually  repos  vehicle,  bank  gets  car  back,  bank  inspects  car,  bank  asks  cosigner  for  X  amount  (sometimes  nothing  but  not  usually),  cosigner  pays  X,  bank  does  not  hit  cosigners  credit,  bank  releases  loan  and  sells  car.    I  am  writing  this  like  it  is  easy  but  it  really  requires  that  asset  is  still  in  good  condition,  that  cosigner  can  get  to  the  asset,  and  that  the  "friend"  still  is  around  and  trusts  cosigner.    I  have  seen  more  than  a  few  cosigners  promise  to  deliver  and  come  up  short  and  couple  conspiring  with  the  "friend".      I  basically  think  most  of  the  advice  you  have  gotten  so  far  is  crap  and  you  haven't  provided  enough  info  to  give  perfect  advice.    Seeking  a  lawyer  is  a  joke.    Going  after  a  fleeing  party  could  eat  up  40-50  billable  hours.    It  isn't  like  you  are  suing  a  business  or  something.    The  lawyer  could  cost  as  much  as  repaying  the  loan  -  and  most  lawyers  will  act  like  it  is  a  snap  of  their  fingers  until  they  have  bled  you  dry  -  just  really  unsound  advice.  For  the  most  part  I  would  suggest  talking  to  the  bank  and  defaulting  but  again  need  100%  of  the  details.      The  other  part  is  cosigning  the  loan.    Why  the  hell  would  you  cosign  a  loan  for  a  friend?    Most  parents  won't  cosign  a  loan  for  their  own  kids.    And  if  you  are  cosigning  a  loan,  you  write  up  a  simple  contract  and  make  the  non-payment  penalties  extremely  costly  for  your  friend.    I  have  seen  simple  contracts  that  include  30%  interests  rates  that  were  upheld  by  courts.
2755	The  point  of  co-signing  for  a  friend  is  that  they're  your  friend.    You  signed  for  them  in  the  belief  that  your  friendship  would  ensure  they  didn't  burn  you.    If  your  friend  has  hung  you  out  to  dry,  basically  they  aren't  your  friend  any  more.  Before  you  lawyer  up,  how's  about  talking  to  your  friend  as  a  friend?    Sure  he  may  have  moved  away  from  the  area,  but  Facebook  is  still  a  thing,  right?    It's  possible  he  doesn't  even  realise  you're  taking  the  fall  for  him.  And  presumably  you  have  mutual  friends  too.    If  he's  blanking  you  then  he  does  know  you're  taking  the  fall  and  doesn't  care.    So  call/message  them  too  and  let  them  know  the  situation.    Chances  are  he  doesn't  want  all  his  other  friends  cutting  him  off  because  they  can  see  he'd  treat  them  the  same  way  he's  treating  you.    And  chances  are  they'll  give  you  his  number  and  new  address,  because  they  don't  want  to  be  in  the  middle.  If  this  fails,  look  at  the  loan.    If  it's  a  loan  secured  against  something  of  his  (e.g.  a  car),  let  it  go.    The  bank  will  repossess  it,  and  that's  job  done.    Of  course  it  will  look  bad  on  your  credit  for  a  while,  but  you're  basically  stuck  with  that.
403969	You  promised  to  pay  the  loan  if  he  didn't.    That  was  a  commitment,  and  I  recommend  "owning"  your  choice  and  following  it  through  to  its  conclusion,  even  if  you  never  do  that  again.    TLDR:  You  made  a  mistake:  own  it,  keep  your  word,  and  embrace  the  lesson.    Why?    Because  you  keep  your  promises.    (Nevermind  that  this  is  a  rare  time  where  your  answer  will  be  directly  recorded,  in  your  credit  report.)  This  isn't  moralism.  I  see  this  as  a  "defining  moment"  in  a  long  game:  10  years  down  the  road  I'd  like  you  to  be  wise,  confident  and  unafraid  in  financial  matters,  with  a  healthy  (if  distant)  relationship  with  our  somewhat  corrupt  financial  system.    I  know  austerity  stinks,  but  having  a  strong  financial  life  will  bring  you  a  lot  more  money  in  the  long  run.  Many  are  leaping  to  the  conclusions  that  this  is  an  "EX-friend"  who  did  this  deliberately.    Don't  assume  this.  For  instance,  it's  quite  possible  your  friend  sold  the  (car?)  at  a  dealer,  who  failed  to  pay  off  this  note,  or  did  and  the  lender  botched  the  paperwork.    And  when  the  collector  called,  he  told  them  that,  thinking  the  collector  would  fix  it,  which  they  don't  do.  The  point  is,  you  don't  know:  your  friend  may  be  an  innocent  party  here.    Creditors  generally  don't  report  late  payments  to  the  credit  bureaus  until  they're  30  days  late.    But  as  a  co-signer,  you're  in  a  bad  spot:  you're  liable  for  the  payments,  but  they  don't  send  you  a  bill.    So  when  you  hear  about  it,  it's  already  nearly  30  days  late.    You  don't  get  any  extra  grace  period  as  a  co-signer.  So  you  need  to  make  a  payment  right  away  to  keep  that  from  going  30  late,  or  if  it's  already  30  late,  to  keep  it  from  going  any  later.      If  it  is  later  determined  that  it  was  not  necessary  for  you  to  make  those  payments,  the  lender  should  give  them  back  to  you.    A  less  reputable  lender  may  resist,  and  you  may  have  to  threaten  small  claims  court,  which  is  a  great  expense  to  them.  Cheaper  to  pay  you.    They  say  France  is  the  nation  of  love.  They  say  America  is  the  nation  of  commerce.    So  it's  not  surprising  that  here,  people  are  quick  to  burn  a  lasting  friendship  over  a  temporary  financial  issue.    Just  saying,  that  isn't  necessarily  the  right  answer.    I  don't  know  about  you,  but  my  friends  all  have  warts.    Nobody's  perfect.    Financial  issues  are  just  another  kind  of  wart.    And  financial  life  in  America  is  hard,  because  we  let  commerce  run  amok.    And  because  our  obsession  with  it  makes  it  a  "loaded"  issue  and  thus  hard  to  talk  about.    Perhaps  your  friend  is  in  trouble  but  the  actual  villain  is  a  predatory  lender.    Point  is,  the  friendship  may  be  more  important  than  this  temporary  adversity.    The  right  answer  may  be  to  come  together  and  figure  out  how  to  make  it  work.    Yes,  it's  also  possible  he's  a  human  leech  who  hops  from  person  to  person,  charming  them  into  cosigning  for  him.  But  to  assume  that  right  out  of  the  gate  is  a  bit  silly.    The  first  question  I'd  ask  is  "where's  the  car?"  (If  it's  a  car).  Many  lenders,  especially  those  who  loan  to  poor  credit  risks,  put  trackers  in  the  car.    They  can  tell  you  where  it  is,  or  at  least,  where  it  was  last  seen  when  the  tracker  stopped  working.    If  that  is  a  car  dealer's  lot,  for  instance,  that  would  be  very  informative.      Simply  reaching  out  to  the  lender  may  get  things  moving,  if  there's  just  a  paperwork  issue  behind  this.    Many  people  deal  with  life  troubles  by  fleeing:  they  dread  picking  up  the  phone,  they  fearfully  throw  summons  in  the  trash.    This  is  a  terrifying  and  miserable  way  to  deal  with  such  a  situation.    They  learn  nothing,  and  it's  pure  suffering.      I  prefer  and  recommend  the  opposite:  turn  into  it,  deal  with  it  head-on,  get  ahead  of  it.      Ask  questions,  google  things,  read,  become  an  expert  on  the  thing.  Be  the  one  calling  the  lender,  not  the  other  way  round.    This  way  it  becomes  a  technical  learning  experience  that's  interesting  and  fun  for  you,  and  the  lender  is  dreading  your  calls  instead  of  the  other  way  'round.    I've  been  sued.    It  sucked.    But  I  took  it  on  boldly,  and  and  actually  led  the  fight  and  strategy  (albeit  with  counsel).    And  turned  it  around  so  he  wound  up  paying  my  legal  bills.    HA!    With  that  precious  experience,  I  know  exactly  what  to  do...  I  don't  fear  being  sued,  or  if  absolutely  necessary,  suing.      You  might  as  well  get  the  best  financial  education.    You're  paying  the  tuition!
466342	Another  option,  not  yet  discussed  here,  is  to  allow  the  loan  to  go  into  default  and  let  the  loaning  agency  repossess  the  property  the  loan  was  used  for,  after  which  they  sell  it  and  that  sale  should  discharge  some  significant  portion  of  the  loan.  Knowing  where  the  friend  and  property  is,  you  may  be  able  to  help  them  carry  out  the  repossession  by  providing  them  information.  Meanwhile,  your  credit  will  take  a  significant  hit,  but  unless  your  name  is  on  the  deed/title  of  the  property  then  you  have  little  claim  that  the  property  is  yours  just  because  you're  paying  the  loan.  The  contract  you  signed  for  the  loan  is  not  going  to  be  easily  bypassed  with  a  lawsuit  of  any  sort,  so  unless  you  can  produce  another  contract  between  you  and  your  friend  it's  unlikely  that  you  can  even  sue  them.  In  short,  you  have  no  claim  to  the  property,  but  the  loaning  agency  does  -  perhaps  that's  the  only  way  to  avoid  paying  most  of  the  debt,  but  you  do  trade  some  of  your  credit  for  it.  Hopefully  you  understand  that  what  you  loaned  wasn't  money,  but  your  credit  score  and  earning  potential,  and  that  you  will  be  more  careful  who  you  choose  to  lend  this  to  in  the  future.
541298	I  would  like  to  add  one  minor  point  for  clarity:  Cosigning  means  that  you,  alongside  your  friend,  enter  into  a  contract  with  the  bank.  It  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  you  now  have  a  contract  with  your  friend,  although  that  could  implicitly  be  concluded.  If  the  bank  makes  use  of  their  contracted  right  to  make  you  pay  your  friend's  debts  with  them,  this  has  no  effect  on  your  legal  relationship  with  your  friend.  Of  course,  you  can  hold  him  or  her  liable  for  your  damages  he  or  she  has  caused.  It  is  another  question  whether  this  would  help  you  in  practice,  but  that  has  been  discussed  before.
24864	Without  all  the  details  it's  hard  to  tell  what  options  you  may  have,  but  none  of  them  are  good.    When  you  cosign  you  are  saying  that,  you  believe  the  primary  signer  will  make  good  on  the  loan,  but  that  if  he  doesn't  you  will.  You  are  100%  responsible  for  this  debt.  As  such,  there  are  some  actions  you  can  take.  First,  really  try  to  stress  to  your  friend,  that  they  need  to  get  you  outta  this  loan.  Urge  them  to  re-finance  with  out  you  if  they  can.  Next  look  for  "better"  ways  of  defaulting  on  the  loan  and  take  them.  Depending  on  what  the  loan  is  for  you  could  deed-in-lue  or  short  sale.  You  may  just  have  to  admit  default.  If  you  work  with  the  bank,  and  try  not  to  drag  out  the  process,  you  will  likely  end  up  in  a  better  place  down  the  line.    Also  of  importance  is  ownership.  If  you  pay  the  loan,  do  you  get  ownership  of  the  thing  the  loan  was  secured  against?  Usually  not,  but  working  with  an  attorney  and  the  bank,  maybe.  For  example,  if  it's  a  car,  can  the  "friend"  sign  over  the  car  to  you,  then  you  sell  it,  and  reduce  your  debt.    Basically  as  a  cosigner,  you  have  some  rights,  but  you  have  all  the  responsibilities.  You  need  to  talk  to  an  attorney  and  possibly  the  bank,  and  see  what  your  options  are.  At  this  point,  if  you  think  the  friend  is  not  that  much  of  a  friend  anymore,  it's  time  to  make  sure  that  any  conversation  you  have  with  them  is  recorded  in  email,  or  on  paper.
438893	Sue  the  friend.  When  you  win,  garnish  his  wages.  It  does  not  have  to  be  by  so  much  that  it  makes  him  quit  his  job,  but  get  75.00  per  pay  period  to  come  to  you.  This  may  require  the  use  of  a  private  investigator  but,  if  you  want  to  make  this  "friend"  face  consequences,  this  is  your  only  option.  Otherwise,  let  it  go  and  keep  paying  his  bill.
174941	I  came  across  such  a  situation  and  I  am  still  facing  it.  My  friend  borrowed  my  credit  card  for  his  expenses  as  he  had  misplaced  his  debit  card  and  for  the  time  being  had  asked  for  my  credit  card  to  handle  the  expenses  he  does.  He  paid  for  initial  2  months  and  then  was  not  able  to  make  payments,  mainly  due  to  not  being  able  to  arrange  money  or  if  it  was  a  contri  party,  he  would  collect  cash  from  friends  but  again  spend  the  same.  Months  passes  by...  the  bill  had  come  upto  65k  and  calls  from  bank  and  other  respective  organizations  Finally  my  dad  came  into  picture  and  slowly  the  issue  is  resolving  he  has  paid  50K  remaining  is  still  pending.      So  basically,  the  reason  I  shared  this  part  of  story  was  he  is  my  Best  friend  and  in  order  to  not  spoil  our  friendship  I  did  not  want  to  take  any  such  step  which  would  later  on  affect  our  friendship.  This  completely  depends  on  the  individuals  how  they  react  to  the  situation.  Keeping  Ego,  superiority,  favour  sort  of  feelings  and  words  apart  things  can  be  resolved  between  friends.  You  do  not  know  what  is  the  situation  on  the  other  side.    Probably  you  can  connect  with  him  ask  him  to  explain  you  why  is  not  able  to  pay  the  debts  and  take  action  accordingly.  If  he  is  not  able  to  provide  a  proper  reason  then  you  may  take  some  actions  like  mentioned  in  initial  answers,  run  after  the  assets  he  own  or  anything  else.Stay  Calm  and  patient.  Do  not  take  any  such  step  which  you  would  regret  later  on...!
573138	I  think  I'm  reading  that  you  cosigned  a  loan  with  a  friend,  and  they've  stopped  paying  on  their  loan.  Not  a  whole  lot  of  options  here.  You'll  have  to  pay  the  loan  off  by  yourself  or  allow  the  loan  to  go  into  collections  in  hopes  that  you'll  get  more  money  later  and  pay  it  off  then.  Small  claims  court  is  definitely  an  option  at  that  point.  Next  time,  perhaps  try  not  to  cosign  loans  with  friends  unless  you  really  trust  them  and  are  confident  that  you  can  pay  the  loan  off  if  they  cannot.
318045	If  the  bank  is  calling  your  employer,  the  federal  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices  Act  (FDCPA)  limits  where  and  when  debt  collectors  can  contact  consumer  debtors.  In  many  cases,  debt  collectors  that  contact  debtors  at  work  are  violating  the  FDCPA.  http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/a-debt-collector-calling-me-work-is-allowed.html
461018	stocks  represent  ownership  in  a  company.  their  price  can  go  up  or  down  depending  on  how  much  profit  the  company  makes  (or  is  expected  to  make).    stocks  owners  are  sometimes  paid  money  by  the  company  if  the  company  has  extra  cash.    these  payments  are  called  dividends.  bonds  represent  a  debt  that  a  company  owes.    when  you  buy  a  bond,  then  the  company  owes  that  debt  to  you.    typically,  the  company  will  pay  a  small  amount  of  money  on  a  regular  basis  to  the  bond  owner,  then  a  large  lump  some  at  some  point  in  the  future.  assuming  the  company  does  not  file  bankrupcy,  and  you  keep  the  bond  until  it  becomes  worthless,  then  you  know  exactly  how  much  money  you  will  get  from  buying  a  bond.  because  bonds  have  a  fixed  payout  (assuming  no  bankrupcy),  they  tend  to  have  lower  average  returns.    on  the  other  hand,  while  stocks  have  a  higher  average  return,  some  stocks  never  return  any  money.  in  the  usa,  stocks  and  bonds  can  be  purchased  through  a  brokerage  account.  examples  are  etrade,  tradeking,  or  robinhood.com.      before  purchasing  stocks  or  bonds,  you  should  probably  learn  a  great  deal  more  about  other  investment  concepts  such  as:  diversification,  volatility,  interest  rates,  inflation  risk,  capital  gains  taxes,  (in  the  usa:  ira's,  401k's,  the  mortgage  interest  deduction).    at  the  very  least,  you  will  need  to  decide  if  you  want  to  buy  stocks  inside  an  ira  or  in  a  regular  brokerage  account.  you  will  also  probably  want  to  buy  a  low-expense  ration  etf  (e.g.  an  index  fund  etf)  unless  you  feel  confident  in  some  other  choice.
451301	From  Wikipedia  -  Stock:  The  stock  (also  capital  stock)  of  a  corporation  constitutes  the  equity      stake  of  its  owners.  It  represents  the  residual  assets  of  the  company      that  would  be  due  to  stockholders  after  discharge  of  all  senior  claims      such  as  secured  and  unsecured  debt.  Stockholders'  equity  cannot  be      withdrawn  from  the  company  in  a  way  that  is  intended  to  be  detrimental      to  the  company's  creditors  Wikipedia  -  Dividend:  A  dividend  is  a  payment  made  by  a  corporation  to  its  shareholders,      usually  as  a  distribution  of  profits.  When  a  corporation  earns  a      profit  or  surplus,  it  can  re-invest  it  in  the  business  (called      retained  earnings),  and  pay  a  fraction  of  this  reinvestment  as  a      dividend  to  shareholders.  Distribution  to  shareholders  can  be  in  cash      (usually  a  deposit  into  a  bank  account)  or,  if  the  corporation  has  a      dividend  reinvestment  plan,  the  amount  can  be  paid  by  the  issue  of      further  shares  or  share  repurchase.  Wikipedia  -  Bond:  In  finance,  a  bond  is  an  instrument  of  indebtedness  of  the  bond  issuer      to  the  holders.  It  is  a  debt  security,  under  which  the  issuer  owes  the      holders  a  debt  and,  depending  on  the  terms  of  the  bond,  is  obliged  to      pay  them  interest  (the  coupon)  and/or  to  repay  the  principal  at  a      later  date,  termed  the  maturity  date.  Interest  is  usually  payable      at  fixed  intervals  (semiannual,  annual,  sometimes  monthly).  Very  often      the  bond  is  negotiable,  i.e.  the  ownership  of  the  instrument  can  be      transferred  in  the  secondary  market.  This  means  that  once  the  transfer      agents  at  the  bank  medallion  stamp  the  bond,  it  is  highly  liquid  on      the  second  market.  Thus,  stock  is  about  ownership  in  the  company,  dividends  are  the  payments  those  owners  receive,  which  may  be  additional  shares  or  cash  usually,  and  bonds  are  about  lending  money.  Stocks  are  usually  bought  through  brokers  on  various  stock  exchanges  generally.  An  exception  can  be  made  under  "Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plans"  and  other  special  cases  where  an  employee  may  be  given  stock  or  options  that  allow  the  purchase  of  shares  in  the  company  through  various  plans.  This  would  apply  for  Canada  and  the  US  where  I  have  experience  just  as  a  parting  note.  This  is  without  getting  into  Convertible  Bond  that  also  exists:  In  finance,  a  convertible  bond  or  convertible  note  or  convertible  debt      (or  a  convertible  debenture  if  it  has  a  maturity  of  greater  than  10      years)  is  a  type  of  bond  that  the  holder  can  convert  into  a  specified      number  of  shares  of  common  stock  in  the  issuing  company  or  cash  of      equal  value.  It  is  a  hybrid  security  with  debt-  and  equity-like      features.    It  originated  in  the  mid-19th  century,  and  was  used  by      early  speculators  such  as  Jacob  Little  and  Daniel  Drew  to  counter      market  cornering.  Convertible  bonds  are  most  often  issued  by      companies  with  a  low  credit  rating  and  high  growth  potential.
113623	Stock  basically  implies  your  ownership  in  the  company.  If  you  own  1%  ownership  in  a  company,  the  value  of  your  stake  becomes  equal  to  1%  of  the  valuation  of  the  entire  company.  Dividends  are  basically  disbursal  of  company's  profits  to  its  shareholders.  By  holding  stocks  of  a  company,  you  become  eligible  to  receiving  dividends  proportional  to  your  ownership  in  the  company.  Dividends  though  are  not  guaranteed,  as  the  company  may  incur  losses  or  the  management  may  decide  to  use  the  cash  for  future  growth  instead  of  disbursing  it  to  the  shareholders.  For  example,  let's  say  a  company  called  ABC  Inc,  is  listed  on  NYSE  and  has  a  total  of  1  million  shares  issued.  Let's  say  if  you  purchase  100  stocks  of  ABC,  your  ownership  in  ABC  will  become  Let's  say  that  the  share  price  at  the  time  of  purchase  was  $10  each.  Total  Investment  =  Stock  Price  *  Number  of  Stocks  Purchased  =  $10  *  100  =  $1,000  Now,  let's  say  that  the  company  declares  a  dividend  of  $1  per  share.  Then,    Dividend  Yield  =  Dividend/Stock  Price  =  $1/$10  =  10%  If  one  has  to  draw  analogy  with  other  banking  products,  one  can  think  of  stock  and  dividend  as  Fixed  Deposits  (analogous  to  stock)  and  the  interest  earned  on  the  Fixed  Deposit  (analogous  to  dividend).
324386	Living  in  one  unit  of  a  multi-family  while  renting  out  the  others,  although  not  without  its  risks,  can  be  a  viable  (if  gradual)  way  to  build  wealth.  It's  been  rebranded  recently  as  "house  hacking",  but  the  underlying  mechanics  have  been  around  for  many  years  (many  cities  in  the  Northeast  in  particular  remain  chock  full  of  neighborhoods  of  3-family  homes  built  and  used  for  exactly  that  purpose  for  decades,  though  now  frequently  sub-divided  into  condos).    It's  true  you'd  need  to  borrow  money,  but  there  are  a  number  of  reasons  why  it's  certainly  at  least  worth  exploring  (which  is  what  you  seem  to  be  asking  --  should  you  bother  doing  the  homework  --  tl;dr:  yes):  And  yes,  you  would  be  relying  on  tenants  to  meet  your  monthly  expenses,  including  a  mortgage  bill  that  will  arrive  whether  the  other  units  are  vacant  or  not.  But  in  most  markets,  rental  prices  are  far  less  volatile  than  home  prices  (from  the  San  Francisco  Federal  Reserve):  The  main  result  from  this  decomposition  is  that  the  behavior  of  the      price-rent  ratio  for  housing  mirrors  that  of  the  price-dividend  ratio      for  stocks.  The  majority  of  the  movement  of  the  price-rent  ratio  comes      from  future  returns,  not  rental  growth  rates.  (Emphasis  added)  It's  also  important  to  remember  that  rental  income  must  do  more  than  just  cover  your  mortgage  --  there's  lots  of  other  expenses  associated  with  a  rental  property,  including  insurance,  taxes,  maintenance,  vacancy  (an  allowance  for  the  periods  when  the  property  will  be  empty  in  between  tenants),  reserves  for  capital  improvements,  and  more.  As  with  any  investment,  it's  all  about  whether  the  numbers  work.  (You  mentioned  not  being  interested  in  the  "upkeep  work",  so  that's  another  8-10%  off  the  top  to  pay  for  a  property  manager.)  If  you  can  find  a  property  at  an  attractive  price,  secure  financing  on  attractive  terms,  and  can  be  reasonably  confident  that  it  will  rent  in  the  ballpark  of  1.5-2%  of  the  purchase  price,  then  it  might  be  a  fine  choice  for  you,  assuming  you  are  willing  and  able  to  handle  the  work  of  being  a  landlord  --  something  worth  at  least  as  much  of  your  research  time  as  the  investment  itself.    It  sounds  like  you're  still  a  ways  away  from  having  enough  for  even  an  FHA  down  payment,  which  gives  you  a  great  opportunity  to  find  and  talk  with  some  local  folks  who  already  manage  rental  properties  in  your  area  (for  example,  you  might  look  for  a  local  chapter  of  the  national  Real  Estate  Investment  Association),  to  get  a  sense  of  what's  really  involved.
208783	Do  not  borrow  to  invest  in  real  estate.    The  interest  payments  will  eat  up  most  of  your  profit  (the  property  management  fees  might  eat  up  the  rest),  and  you  will  have  significant  risk  with  tenant  issues,  property  value,  etc.    Many  people  have  made  it  work  -  many  also  lose  everything.  Real  estate  can  be  a  great  investment,  but  you  can't  even  afford  a  house  of  your  own  yet,  let  alone  investment  property.    Keep  saving  up  until  you  have  20%  down  to  buy  a  house  of  your  own  (ideally  that  you  can  put  on  a  15%  fixed  mortgage),  and  pay  it  off  as  quickly  as  you  can.    Then  you  can  start  saving  for  your  first  rental  property.  If  that  process  isn't  fast  enough  for  you,  you  have  two  options.    Increase  your  income  or  reduce  your  expenses.    There's  no  shortcut  to  wealth-building  without  taking  significant  risks.  At  most  I  would  scale  back  the  401(k)  to  the  5%  match  you  get,  but  you  should  scale  that  back  up  once  you  have  enough  for  a  down  payment.
63649	You  say    My  work  is  steady;  even  if  I  lost  my  job  it'd  be  easy  to  get  another.  Location  has  been  static  for  a  few  years  now,  but  I'm  not  sure  that'll  extrapolate  to  the  future;  I'm  lazy,  so  I  don't  want  to  move,  but  for  a  significantly  better  job  opportunity  I  wouldn't  mind.      The  general  rule  of  thumb  is  that  you'll  come  out  ahead  if  you  buy  a  house  (with  a  mortgage)  and  live  there  for  five  years.    What  you  lose  in  interest,  you  make  up  in  rent.    And  living  there  for  five  years,  you  make  back  your  closing  costs  in  equity.    If  you're  there  less  than  five  years  though,  you  don't  make  back  the  closing  costs.    You'd  have  been  better  off  renting.      Historically  (up  to  about  twenty  years  ago),  your  mortgage  payment  and  rent  payment  for  the  same  basic  property  would  be  about  the  same.    I.e.  if  your  current  landlord  sold  you  what  you  are  renting,  your  mortgage  payment  would  be  roughly  the  same  as  your  rent.    Maybe  a  little  lower  or  a  little  higher  but  about  the  same.    More  recently,  it  hasn't  been  strange  to  see  a  divergence  in  those.    Now  it  is  not  uncommon  for  a  mortgage  payment  to  be  50%  higher  than  rent  on  the  same  property.      This  has  some  consequences.    First,  your  $1000  rent  probably  won't  stretch  as  far  as  a  $1000  mortgage  payment.    So  you'll  be  buying  something  that  you'd  only  pay  $650  or  $700  rent.    Second,  if  you  move  and  can't  sell  immediately,  you'll  get  less  in  rent  than  you'd  pay  in  mortgage.    Rather  than  contributing  to  your  income,  the  property  will  require  subsidy  just  to  maintain  the  mortgage.    And  in  the  early  years  of  the  mortgage,  this  means  that  you're  paying  all  of  the  principal  (equity)  and  some  of  the  interest.      Buying  a  duplex  makes  this  worse.    You  have  your  side  and  their  side.    You  can  substitute  your  $1000  rent  for  half  of  the  mortgage  payment.    Meanwhile,  they  are  paying  $700  in  rent.    You  have  to  subsidize  the  mortgage  by  $300.    Plus,  you  are  talking  about  hiring  a  property  management  company  to  do  things  like  lawn  maintenance.    There  goes  another  $100  a  month.    So  you  are  subsidizing  the  mortgage  by  $400.      I  don't  know  real  estate  prices  in  Utah,  but  a  quick  search  finds  a  median  house  price  over  $200,000.    So  it  seems  unlikely  that  you  are  buying  new  construction  with  new  appliances.    More  likely  you  are  buying  an  existing  duplex  with  existing  appliances.    What  happens  when  they  fail?    The  renter  doesn't  pay  for  that.    The  property  management  company  doesn't  pay  for  that  (although  they'll  likely  arrange  for  it  to  happen).    You  pay  for  it.      Also,  it  often  takes  a  bit  of  time  to  clean  up  the  apartment  after  one  tenant  leaves  before  the  new  tenant  starts  paying  rent.    That's  a  dead  weight  loss.    If  this  happens  during  a  local  recession,  you  could  be  carrying  the  mortgage  on  a  property  with  no  offsetting  rental  income  for  months.      There  are  some  countervailing  forces.    For  example,  if  house  prices  in  your  area  are  increasing,  the  rent  will  increase  with  them  (not  necessarily  at  the  same  pace).    But  your  mortgage  payment  stays  the  same.    So  eventually  the  rent  may  catch  up  with  the  mortgage  payment.    If  you  wait  long  enough  in  a  strong  enough  market,  the  rent  on  the  other  half  of  the  duplex  may  cover  the  entire  mortgage  payment.      If  you  currently  have  an  urban  apartment  within  walking  distance  of  work  and  switch  to  a  suburban  apartment  with  a  commute,  you  have  a  better  chance  of  finding  a  duplex  where  the  entire  mortgage  payment  is  only  the  $1000  that  you  pay  in  rent.    Your  half  of  the  duplex  won't  be  as  nice  as  your  apartment  is,  and  you'll  have  a  half  hour  or  hour  long  commute  every  morning  (and  the  same  to  get  home  in  the  evening).    But  on  strictly  fiscal  terms  you'll  be  doing  about  as  well.    Plus  you  have  the  income  from  the  other  half.    So  even  if  your  mortgage  payment  is  more  than  your  rent  payment,  you  can  still  break  even  if  the  rent  covers  it.      Consider  a  $1400  mortgage  and  $400  in  rent  from  the  other  half  (after  property  management  fees).    So  long  as  nothing  goes  wrong,  you  break  even.    Perhaps  the  agreement  is  that  your  parents  take  care  of  things  going  wrong  (broken  appliances,  troublesome  tenants,  time  between  tenants).    Or  perhaps  you  drain  your  emergency  fund  and  adjust  your  401(k)  payment  down  to  the  minimum  when  that  happens.    Once  your  emergency  fund  is  replenished,  restore  the  401(k).      If  you're  willing  to  live  in  what's  essentially  a  $500  apartment,  you  can  do  better  this  way.    Of  course,  you  can  also  do  better  by  living  in  a  $500  apartment  and  banking  the  other  $500  that  you  spend  on  rent.    Plus  you  now  have  the  expenses  of  a  commute  and  five  hours  less  free  time  a  week.      You  describe  yourself  as  essentially  living  paycheck  to  paycheck.    You  have  adequate  savings  but  no  building  excess.    Whatever  you  get  paid,  you  immediately  turn  around  and  spend.    Your  parents  may  view  you  as  profligate.    Your  apartment  is  nicer  than  their  early  apartments  were.    You  go  out  more  often.    You're  not  putting  anything  aside  for  later  (except  retirement).      It  didn't  use  to  be  at  all  strange  for  people  to  move  out  of  the  city  because  they  needed  more  space.    For  the  same  rent  they  were  paying  in  the  city,  they  could  buy  a  house  in  the  suburbs.    Then  they'd  build  up  equity.    So  long  as  they  stayed  in  roughly  the  same  work  location,  they  didn't  need  to  move  until  they  were  ready  to  upgrade  their  house.      The  duplex  plan  leads  to  one  of  two  things.    Either  you  sell  the  duplex  and  use  the  equity  to  buy  a  nicer  regular  house,  or  you  move  out  of  the  duplex  and  rent  your  half.    Now  you  have  a  rental  property  providing  income.    And  if  you  saved  enough  for  a  down  payment,  you  can  still  buy  a  regular  house.      From  your  parents'  perspective,  encouraging  you  to  buy  a  duplex  may  be  the  equivalent  of  asking  you  to  cut  back  on  spending.    Rather  than  reducing  your  401(k)  deposits,  they  may  be  envisioning  you  trading  in  your  car  for  a  cheaper  one  and  trading  in  your  nice  but  expensive  apartment  for  something  more  reasonable  in  a  cheaper  neighborhood.    Rather  than  working  with  a  property  management  company,  you'll  be  out  doing  yardwork  rather  than  cavorting  with  your  friends.    And  maybe  the  new  place  would  have  more  space  to  share  when  you  meet  someone--you  aren't  going  to  provide  many  grandkids  alone.      If  you  get  a  mortgage  on  a  duplex,  you  are  responsible  for  paying  the  mortgage.    You  are  responsible  even  if  something  happens  to  the  house.    For  example,  if  a  fire  burns  it  down  or  a  tornado  takes  it  away.    Or  you  just  find  that  the  house  isn't  solid  enough  to  support  that  party  where  all  of  your  friends  are  jumping  up  and  down  to  the  latest  pop  sensation.    So  beyond  losing  whatever  you  invest  in  the  property,  you  may  also  lose  what  you  borrowed.      Now  consider  what  happens  if  you  invest  the  same  amount  of  money  in  General  Motors  as  in  the  house.    Let's  call  that  $10,000  and  give  the  house  a  value  of  $200,000.    With  General  Motors,  even  if  they  go  bankrupt  tomorrow,  you're  only  out  $10,000.    With  the  house,  you're  out  $200,000.    Admittedly  it's  much  hard  to  lose  the  entire  $200,000  value  of  the  house.    But  even  if  the  house  loses  $80,000  in  value,  you  are  still  $70,000  in  the  hole.      You  don't  need  a  disaster  for  the  house  to  lose  $80,000  in  value.    That's  pretty  much  what  happened  in  the  2006-2010  period.    People  were  losing  all  of  what  they  invested  in  houses  plus  having  to  declare  bankruptcy  to  get  out  of  the  excess  debt.    Of  course,  if  they  had  been  able  to  hold  on  until  2015  markets  mostly  recovered.    But  if  you  lost  your  job  in  2008,  they  wouldn't  let  you  not  make  mortgage  payments  until  you  got  a  new  one  in  2012.      When  you  declare  bankruptcy,  you  don't  just  lose  the  house.    You  also  lose  all  your  emergency  savings  and  may  lose  some  of  your  belongings.      There  are  some  pretty  prosaic  disasters  too.    For  example,  you  and  your  tenant  both  go  away  for  a  weekend.    It  rains  heavily  and  your  roof  starts  to  leak  due  to  weak  maintenance  (so  not  covered  by  insurance).    The  house  floods,  destroying  all  the  electronics  and  damaging  various  other  things.    Bad  enough  if  it's  just  you,  but  you're  also  responsible  for  the  tenant's  belongings.    They  sue  you  for  $20,000  and  they  move  out.    So  no  rent  and  big  expenses.    To  get  the  house  livable  again  is  going  to  take  $160,000.    Plus  you  have  a  $190,000  mortgage  on  a  property  that  is  only  worth  about  $40,000.    That's  at  the  extreme  end.
354136	This  answer  is  applicable  to  the  US.    Similar  rules  may  hold  in  some  other  countries  as  well.      The  shares  in  an  open-ended  (non-exchange-traded)  mutual  fund  are  not  traded  on  stock  exchanges  and  the  "market"  does  not  determine  the  share  price  the  way  it  does  for  shares  in  companies  as  brokers  make  offers  to  buy  and  sell  stock  shares.  The  price  of  one  share  of    the  mutual  fund  (usually  called  Net  Asset  Value  (NAV)  per  share)  is  usually  calculated  at  the  close  of  business,  and  is,  as  the  name  implies,  the  net  worth  of  all  the  shares  in  companies  that  the  fund  owns  plus  cash  on  hand  etc  divided  by  the  number  of  mutual  fund  shares  outstanding.  The  NAV  per  share  of  a  mutual  fund  might  or  might  not  increase  in  anticipation  of  the  distribution  to  occur,  but  the  NAV  per  share  very  definitely  falls  on    the  day  that  the  distribution  is  declared.  If  you  choose  to  re-invest  your  distribution  in  the  same  fund,  then  you  will  own  more  shares  at  a  lower  NAV  per  share  but  the  total  value  of  your  investment  will  not  change  at  all.    If  you  had  100  shares  currently  priced  at  $10  and    the  fund  declares  a  distribution  of  $2  per  share,  you  will    be  reinvesting  $200  to  buy  more  shares  but  the  fund  will  be  selling  you  additional  shares  at  $8  per  share  (and  of  course,  the  100  shares  you  hold  will  be  priced  at  $8  per  share  too.    So,  you  will  have  100  previous  shares  worth  only  $800  now  +  25  new  shares  worth  $200  for  a  total  of  125  shares  at  $8  =  $1000  total  investment,  just  as  before.  If  you  take  the  distribution  in  cash,  then  you  still  hold  the  100  shares  but  they  are  worth  only  $800  now,  and  the  fund  will  send  you  the  $200  as  cash.  Either  way,  there  is  no  change  in  your  net  worth.  However,  (assuming  that  the  fund  is  is  not  in  a  tax-advantaged  account),  that  $200  is  taxable  income  to  you  regardless  of  whether  you  reinvest  it  or  take  it  as  cash.  The  fund  will  tell  you  what  part  of  that  $200  is  dividend  income  (as  well  as  what  part  is  Qualified  Dividend  income),    what  part  is  short-term  capital  gains,  and  what  part  is  long-term  capital  gains;  you  declare  the  income  in  the  appropriate  categories  on  your  tax  return,  and  are  taxed  accordingly.  So,  what  advantage  is  there  in  re-investing?  Well,  your  basis  in  those  shares  has  increased  and  so  if  and  when  you  sell  the  shares,  you  will  owe  less  tax.  If  you  had  bought  the  original  100  shares  at  $10  and  sell  the  125  shares  a  few  years  later  at  $11  and  collect  $1375,  you  owe  (long-term  capital  gains)  tax  on    just  $1375-$1200  =$175    (which  can  also  be  calculated  as  $1  gain  on  each  of  the  original  100  shares  =  $100  plus  $3  gain  on  the  25  new  shares  =  $175).  In  the  past,  some  people  would  forget  the  intermediate  transactions  and  think  that  they  had  invested  $1000  initially  and  gotten  $1375  back  for  a  gain  of  $375  and  pay  taxes  on  $375  instead.  This  is  less  likely  to  occur  now  since  mutual  funds  are  now  required  to  report  more  information  on  the  sale  to  the  shareseller  than  they  used  to  in  the  past.  So,  should  you  buy  shares  in  a  mutual  fund  right  now?  Most  mutual  fund  companies  publish  preliminary  estimates  in  November  and  December  of  what  distributions  each  fund  will  be  making  by  the  end  of  the  year.  They  also  usually  advise  against  purchasing  new  shares  during  this  period  because  one  ends  up  "buying  a  dividend".    If,  for  example,  you  bought  those  100  shares  at  $10  on  the  Friday  after  Thanksgiving  and  the  fund  distributes  that  $2  per  share    on  December  15,  you  still  have  $1000  on  December  15,  but  now  owe  taxes  on  $200  that  you  would  not  have  had  to  pay  if  you  had  postponed  buying  those  shares  till  after  the  distribution  was  paid.  Nitpickers:  for  simplicity  of  exposition,  I  have  not  gone  into  the  detailed  chronology  of  when  the  fund  goes  ex-dividend,  when  the  distribution  is  recorded,    and  when  cash  is  paid  out,  etc.,  but  merely  treated  all  these  events  as  happening  simultaneously.
129350	There  are  many  reasons  for  buying  new  versus  used  vehicles.  Price  is  not  the  only  factor.    This  is  an  individual  decision.  Although  interesting  to  examine  from  a  macro  perspective,  each  vehicle  purchase  is  made  by  an  individual,  weighing  many  factors  that  vary  in  importance  by  that  individual,  based  upon  their  specific  needs  and  values.  I  have  purchased  both  new  and  used  cars,  and  I  have  weighted  each  of  these  factors  as  part  of  each  decision  (and  the  relative  weightings  have  varied  based  upon  my  individual  situation).  Read  Freakonomics  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  reasons  why  you  cannot  find  a  good  used  car.  The  summary  is  the  imbalance  of  knowledge  between  the  buyer  and  seller,  and  the  lack  of  trust.  Although  much  of  economics  assumes  perfect  market  information,  margin  (profit)  comes  from  uncertainty,  or  an  imbalance  of  knowledge.    Buying  a  used  car  requires  a  certain  amount  of  faith  in  people,  and  you  cannot  always  trust  the  trading  partner  to  be  honest.  Price  -  The  price,  or  more  precisely,  the  value  proposition  of  the  vehicle  is  a  large  concern  for  many  of  us  (larger  than  we  might  prefer  that  it  be).  Selection  -  A  buyer  has  the  largest  selection  of  vehicles  when  they  shop  for  a  new  vehicle.  Finding  the  color,  features,  and  upgrades  that  you  want  on  your  vehicle  can  be  much  harder,  even  impossible,  for  the  used  buyer.  And  once  you  have  found  the  exact  vehicle  you  want,  now  you  have  to  determine  whether  the  vehicle  has  problems,  and  can  be  purchased  at  your  price.  Preference  -  A  buyer  may  simply  prefer  to  have  a  vehicle  that  looks  new,  smells  new,  is  clean,  and  does  not  have  all  the  imperfections  that  even  a  gently  used  vehicle  would  exhibit.  This  may  include  issues  of  pride,  image,  and  status,  where  the  buyer  may  have  strong  emotional  or  psychological  needs  to  statisfy  through  ownership  of  a  particular  vehicle  with  particular  features.  Reviews  -  New  vehicles  have  mountains  of  information  available  to  buyers,  who  can  read  about  safety  and  reliability  ratings,  learn  about  problems  from  the  trade  press,  and  even  price  shop  and  compare  between  brands  and  models.  Contrasted  with  the  minimal  information  available  to  used  vehicle  shoppers.  Unbalanced  Knowledge  -  The  seller  of  a  used  car  has  much  greater  knowledge  of  the  vehicle,  and  thus  much  greater  power  in  the  negotiation  process.  Buying  a  used  car  is  going  to  cost  you  more  money  than  the  value  of  the  car,  unless  the  seller  has  poor  knowledge  of  the  market.  And  since  many  used  cars  are  sold  by  dealers  (who  have  often  taken  advantage  of  the  less  knowledgeable  sellers  in  their  transaction),  you  are  unlikely  to  purchase  the  vehicle  at  a  good  price.  Fear/Risk  -  Many  people  want  transportation,  and  buying  a  used  car  comes  with  risk.  And  that  risk  includes  both  the  direct  cost  of  repairs,  and  the  inconvenience  of  both  the  repair  and  the  loss  of  work  that  accompanies  problems.  Knowing  that  the  car  has  not  been  abused,  that  there  are  no  hidden  or  lurking  problems  waiting  to  leave  you  stranded  is  valuable.  Placing  a  price  on  the  risk  of  a  used  car  is  hard,  especially  for  those  who  only  want  a  reliable  vehicle  to  drive.  Placing  an  estimate  on  the  risk  cost  of  a  used  car  is  one  area  where  the  seller  has  a  distinct  advantage.  Warranties  -  New  vehicles  come  with  substantial  warranties,  and  this  is  another  aspect  of  the  Fear/Risk  point  above.  A  new  vehicle  does  not  have  unknown  risk  associated  with  the  purchase,  and  also  comes  with  peace  of  mind  through  a  manufacturer  warranty.  You  can  purchase  a  used  car  warranty,  but  they  are  expensive,  and  often  come  with  (different)  problems.  Finance  Terms  -  A  buyer  can  purchase  a  new  vehicle  with  lower  financing  rate  than  a  used  vehicle.  And  you  get  nothing  of  value  from  the  additional  finance  charges,  so  the  difference  between  a  new  and  used  car  also  includes  higher  finance  costs.  Own  versus  Rent  -  You  are  assuming  that  people  actually  want  to  'own'  their  cars.  And  I  would  suggest  that  people  want  to  'own'  their  car  until  it  begins  to  present  problems  (repair  and  maintenance  issues),  and  then  they  want  a  new  vehicle  to  replace  it.  But  renting  or  leasing  a  vehicle  is  an  even  more  expensive,  and  less  flexible  means  to  obtain  transportation.  Expense  Allocation  -  A  vehicle  is  an  expense.  As  the  owner  of  a  vehicle,  you  are  willing  to  pay  for  that  expense,  to  fill  your  need  for  transportation.  Paying  for  the  product  as  you  use  the  product  makes  sense,  and  financing  is  one  way  to  align  the  payment  with  the  consumption  of  the  product,  and  to  pay  for  the  expense  of  the  vehicle  as  you  enjoy  the  benefit  of  the  vehicle.  Capital  Allocation  -  A  buyer  may  need  a  vehicle  (either  to  commute  to  work,  school,  doctor,  or  for  work  or  business),  but  either  lack  the  capital  or  be  unwilling  to  commit  the  capital  to  the  vehicle  purchase.  Vehicle  financing  is  one  area  banks  have  been  willing  to  lend,  so  buying  a  new  vehicle  may  free  capital  to  use  to  pay  down  other  debts  (credit  cards,  loans).  The  buyer  may  not  have  savings,  but  be  able  to  obtain  financing  to  solve  that  need.  Remember,  people  need  transportation.  And  they  are  willing  to  pay  to  fill  their  need.  But  they  also  have  varying  needs  for  all  of  the  above  factors,  and  each  of  those  factors  may  offer  value  to  different  individuals.
505467	If  everyone  bought  used  cars,  who  would  buy  the  new  cars  so  that  everyone  else  could  buy  them  used?  Rental  car  companies?  Your  rant  expresses  a  misunderstanding  of  fundamental  economics  (as  demand  for  used  cars  increases,  so  will  prices)  but  economics  is  off-topic  here,  so  let  me  explain  why  I  bought  a  new  car—that  I  am  now  in  the  10th  year  of  driving.  When  I  bought  the  car  I  currently  drive,  I  was  single,  I  was  working  full-time,  and  I  was  going  to  school  full-time.  I  bought  a  2007  Toyota  Corolla  for  about  $16,500  cash  out  the  door.  I  wanted  a  reliable  car  that  was  clean  and  attractive  enough  that  I  wouldn't  be  embarrassed  in  it  if  I  took  a  girl  out  for  dinner.  I  could  have  bought  a  much  more  expensive  car,  but  I  wanted  to  be  real  about  myself  and  not  give  the  wrong  impression  about  my  views  on  money.  I've  done  all  the  maintenance,  and  the  car  is  still  very  nice  even  after  105K  miles.  It  will  handle  at  least  that  many  more  miles  barring  any  crashes.  Could  I  have  purchased  a  nice  used  car  for  less?  Certainly,  but  because  it  was  the  last  model  year  before  a  redesign,  the  dealer  was  clearly  motivated  to  give  me  a  good  deal,  so  I  didn't  lose  too  much  driving  it  off  the  lot.  There  are  a  lot  of  reasons  why  people  buy  new  cars.  I  didn't  want  to  look  like  a  chump  when  out  on  a  date.  Real-estate  agents  often  like  to  make  a  good  impression  as  they  are  driving  clients  to  see  new  homes.  Some  people  can  simply  afford  it  and  don't  want  to  worry  about  what  abuse  a  prior  owner  may  have  done.  I  don't  feel  defensive  about  my  decision  to  buy  a  new  car  those  years  ago.  The  other  car  I've  purchased  in  the  last  10  years  was  a  four  year  old  used  car,  and  it  certainly  does  a  good  job  for  my  wife  who  doesn't  put  too  many  miles  on  it.  I  will  not  rule  out  buying  another  new  car  in  the  future  either.  Some  times  the  difference  in  price  isn't  significant  enough  that  used  is  always  the  best  choice.
4038	Two  reasons:  Many  people  make  lots  of  financial  decisions  (and  other  kinds  of  decisions)  without  actually  running  any  numbers  to  see  what  is  best  (or  even  possible).    They  just  go  with  their  gut  and  buy  things  they  feel  like  buying,  without  making  a  thoroughgoing  attempt  to  assess  the  impact  on  their  finances.    I  share  your  bafflement  at  this,  but  it  is  true.  A  sobering  example  that  has  stuck  with  me  can  be  found  in  this  Los  Angeles  Times  story  from  a  few  years  ago,  which  describes  a  family  spending  $1000  more  than  their  income  every  month,  while  defaulting  on  their  mortgage  and  dipping  into  their  7-year-old  daughter's  savings  account  to  cover  the  bills  ---  but  still  spending  $275  a  month  on  "beauty  products  and  services"  and  $200  a  month  on  pet  expenses.  Even  to  the  extent  that  people  do  take  finances  into  account,  finances  are  not  the  only  thing  they  take  into  account.    For  many  people,  driving  a  car  that  is  new,  looks  nice  and  fresh,  has  the  latest  features,  etc.,  is  something  they  are  willing  to  pay  money  for.    Your  question  "why  don't  people  view  a  car  solely  as  a  means  of  transportation"  is  not  a  financial  question  but  a  psychological  one.    The  answer  to  "why  do  people  buy  new  cars"  is  "because  people  do  not  view  cars  solely  as  a  means  of  transportation".  I  recently  bought  a  used  car,  and  while  looking  around  at  different  ones  I  visited  a  car  lot.    When  the  dealer  heard  which  car  I  was  interested  in,  he  said,  "So,  I  guess  you're  looking  for  a  transportation  car."    I  thought  to  myself,  "Duh.    Is  there  any  other  kind?"    But  the  fact  that  someone  can  say  something  like  that  indicates  that  there  are  many  people  who  are  looking  for  something  other  than  a  "transportation  car".
452148	I  had  a  2000  Chevy  Cavalier  until  late  2011.  It  worked  well,  but  was  very  definitely  at  the  end  of  its  life.  This  was  a  low-end  car,  certainly,  but  I  dispute  your  claim  that  cars  last  20  -  25  years.  Consumer  Reports  apparently  says  the  average  life  expectancy  of  a  new  vehicle  is  around  8  years  or  150,000  miles.  When  it  came  time  to  replace  my  Cavalier,  I  was  significantly  concerned  about  car  safety  and  about  the  ability  to  handle  Canadian  winters  (-40  temperatures,  lots  of  snow).  I  chose  a  Subaru  Forester  as  a  good  match  for  me.  I  could  have  bought  one  second-hand,  but  I  wasn't  willing  to  get  one  as  old  as  five  years.  Car  manufacturers  constantly  improve  safety  and  features  over  that  time  period.  The  Forester  is  massively  more  capable  of  handling  Canadian  winters  than  the  Cavalier  was.  If  I  was  buying  a  Forester  now,  I'd  want  the  EyeSight  Driver  Assist  System  which  Subaru  added  a  couple  of  years  after  my  model  year.  The  newer  models  score  slightly  higher  in  crash  tests,  too.  That  would  limit  me  to  2014  or  later  models,  and  I'd  be  concerned  someone  selling  a  2014  or  2015  knew  something  I  didn't,  knew  they  had  purchased  a  lemon.  I  didn't  need  financing  for  my  vehicle.  On  the  other  hand,  I  could  have  invested  the  money  I  saved,  so  if  all  I  wanted  was  something  to  get  me  from  point  A  to  point  B,  my  choice  does  not  make  much  financial  sense.  But  Canadian  winters  are  brutal  and  car  safety  is  massively  important  to  me.  I'm  well  aware  that  I  paid  considerably  for  this,  and  I'm  comfortable  with  my  decision.
303011	The  car  you  dream  of  might  not  be  available  in  your  local  used  car  market.    Or  if  it  is,  there  might  be  something  wrong  with  it.  Here  are  some  reasons  that  a  person  might  want  to  buy  a  new  car.    Basically,  if  you  have  a  picture  in  your  mind  of  what  your  next  car  should  look  like,  it  is  easier  to  shop  for  a  new  car:  New  cars  are  getting  better.    Here  are  some  reasons  that  a  person  might  want  a  newer  generation  car  rather  than  an  older  generation  car:  Cars  wear  out.    Here  are  some  reasons  a  person  shopping  for  a  car  might  pass  on  a  used  car:  In  other  words,  there  are  good  reasons  to  want  a  car  that  is  either  brand  new,  exactly  two  years  old,  or  3  -  5  years  old.    The  brand  new  car  might  be  better  than  the  old  car  ever  was.
494706	Many  reasons  So  in  general  you  are  paying  more  for  peace  of  mind  when  you  buy  a  new  car.  You  expect  everything  to  be  working  and  if  not  you  can  take  it  back  to  the  dealer  to  have  them  fix  it  for  free.
186735	I  would  answer  your  question  very  simply:  marketing  works.  "If  you  don't  have  a  new  F-150,  you  are  not  a  real  man."    for  men,  and  "If  you  don't  have  a  new  Honda  Pilot  your  kids  are  in  danger."  for  woman.    One  observation  that  reinforces  this  are  the  amount  of  new(er)  Buicks  on  the  road.    Five  years  ago,  they  were  pretty  rare,  now  there  are  many.    Their  marketing  strategy  of  "We  don't  suck  so  much  anymore",  seems  to  have  worked.    I  don't  get  it.  Last  year,  Consumer  Reports  reported  that  84.5%  of  new  cars  are  financed  with  an  average  payment  of  $457  over  65  months.      I  like  your  analysis,  but  lets  say  instead  of  following  this  path,  Brad  and  Jenn,  put  $250  a  month  away  in  a  cookie  jar  (to  cover  repairs  and  car  replacement),  and  $664  (457*2-250)  in  a  mutual  fund.    After  doing  this  for  30  years,  they  will  have  1.5  million.    Driving  a  new  car  is  precluding  many  from  being  wealthy.  It  is  hard  to  jump  aboard  the  "income  inequality"  bandwagon  when  you  see  with  brand  new  iphones  and  cars.
10483	Most  people  today  (and  maybe  regardless  of  era)  are  irrational  and  don't  properly  valuate  many  of  their  purchases,  nor  are  they  emotionally  equipped  to  do  the  math  properly,  including  projection  into  the  future  and  applying  probabilities.  This  compounds.    Imagine  that  each  individual  is  bound  to  others  by  a  rubber  band  and  can  stretch  in  a  certain  direction.    The  more  your  neighbors  stretch,  the  more  you  are  both  motivated  to  stretch  and  able  to  stretch.    These  are  crudely  analogous  to  consumer  wants  as  well  as  allowed  consumer  debt.    The  banks  are  also  within  this  network  of  rubber  bands  and  much  of  their  balance  sheet  is  based  on  how  far  they've  stretched  on  the  aggregate  of  all  connected  bands  (counting  others  debts  as  their  credit  because  it  will  presumably  be  repaid),  and  every  so  often  enough  people's  feet  slip  that  a  lot  of  rubber  bands  snap  back.    This  is  a  bubble  bursting.
549759	If  you  don't  know  how  to  fix  your  own  car  or  have  time  to  take  car  parts  off  of  a  car  at  a  junk  yard,  the  average  amount  of  money  per  month  you  spend  on  repairing  an  old  car  will  be  greater  than  the  amount  of  money  you  spend  per  month  on  a  new  car  payment.  This  is  because  car  repair  shops  are  charging  $85  per  hour  for  labor  for  car  repairs.  Many  parts  that  wear  out  on  a  car  are  difficult  to  replace  because  of  their  location  on  the  engine.  The  classic  example  is  piston  rings.

364411	Im  not  sure  if  its  normal/sensical/healthy,  and  that  is  kind  of  opinion  based.  But  there  is  a  reason  for  it.  Certain  rules  and  regulations  passed  recently  are  causing  companies  or  institutions  to  shift  to  bonds  from  cash.  Fidelity,  for  example,  is  completely  converting  its  $100  billion  dollar  cash  fund  to  short  term  bills.  Its  estimated  that  over  $2  trillion  that  is  now  in  cash  may  be  converted  to  bills,  and  that  will  obviously  put  upward  preasure  on  the  price  of  them.  The  treasury  is  trying  to  issue  more  short  term  debt  to  balance  out  the  demand.  read  more  here:  http://www.wsj.com/articles/money-funds-clamor-for-short-term-treasurys-1445300813
306197	I  have  been  charting  the  CPI  reported  inflation  rate  vs  .  the  yeald  on  the  10-year  T-note.  Usually,  the  two  like  to  keep  pace  with  each  other.  Sometimes  the  T-note  is  a  bit  higher  than  the  inflation  rate,  sometimes  the  inflation  rate  is  a  bit  higher  than  the  T-note  yeald.  One  does  not  appear  to  follow  the  other,  but  (until  recently)  the  two  do  not  diverge  from  each  other  by  much.    But  all  that  changed  recently  and  I  am  without  an  explanation  as  to  why.  Inflation  dropped  to  zero  (or  a  bit  negative)  yet  the  yeald  on  the  10-year  T-note  seemed  to  seek  2%.    Edit:  If  you  give  this  response  a  downvote  then  please  be  kind  enough  to  explain  why  in  a  comment.    Edit-2:  CPI  and  10-year  T-note  are  what  I  have  tracked,  and  continue  to  track.  If  you  do  not  like  my  answer  then  provide  a  better  one,  yourself.
394791	Platinum  use  is  pretty  heavily  overweight  in  industrial  areas;  according  to  the  linked  Wikipedia  article,  239  tonnes  of  platinum  was  sold  in  2006,  of  which  130  tonnes  went  to  vehicles  emissions  control  devices  and  another  13.3  tonnes  to  electronics.  Gold  sees  substantial  use  as  an  investment  as  well  as  to  hedge  against  economical  decline  and  inflation,  with  comparatively  little  industrial  ("real  world",  as  some  put  it)  use.  That  is  their  principal  difference  from  an  investment  point  of  view.  According  to  Wikipedia's  article  on  platinum,  ...  during  periods  of  economic  uncertainty,  the  price  of  platinum  tends  to  decrease  due  to  reduced  industrial  demand,  falling  below  the  price  of  gold.  Gold  prices  are  more  stable  in  slow  economic  times,  as  gold  is  considered  a  safe  haven  and  gold  demand  is  not  driven  by  industrial  uses.  If  your  investment  scenario  is  a  tanking  world  economy,  for  reason  of  its  large  industrial  usage,  I  for  one  would  not  count  on  platinum  to  not  fall  in  price.  Of  course  gold  may  fall  in  price  as  well,  but  since  it  is  not  primarily  an  industrial  use  commodity,  I  would  personally  expect  gold  to  do  better  in  such  a  scenario.
259930	@Michael  Kjörling  answered  why  platinum  is  in  demand  like  it  is.    But  it  missed  some  of  the  significant  risks  so  I  will  address  some  of  them.    Platinum  is  much  more  rare  than  gold.    But  not  because  there  is  less  platinum  than  gold  just  that  the  known  existing  platinum  veins  are  smaller  and  more  disbursed.    So  if  a  large  vein  were  found  it  could  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  availability  and  thus  reducing  price  of  platinum.    New  mining  technologies  are  being  developed  every  day.    One  of  these  could  make  exacting  platinum  from  existing  not  platinum  mines  easier  and  more  cost  effective  again  increasing  the  availability  and  reducing  the  price  of  platinum.  The  vast  majority  of  platinum  use  today  is  for  emissions  controls.    There  is  a  lot  of  money  being  thrown  into  research  on  green  energy  and  technologies.    One  of  these  technologies  or  a  side  effect  of  other  research  could  result  in  much  more  cost  effective  ways  to  combat  emissions.    Should  that  happen  I  would  expect  the  price  of  platinum  to  fall  through  the  floor  and  potentially  never  recover.  I  do  not  think  any  of  these  scenarios  are  imminent.  But  the  risks  that  they  present  are  so  great  it  is  important  to  consider  them  before  investing.
157038	It  is  only  wise  to  invest  in  what  you  understand  (ala  Warren  Buffet  style).  Depending  on  how  much  money  you  have,  you  might  see  fit  to  consult  a  good  independent  financial  advisor  instead  of  seeking  advice  from  this  website.  A  famous  quote  goes:  “Those  who  say,  do  not  know.  Those  who  know,  do  not  say”
90406	One  might  hope  for  slightly  more  rationality  in  the  platinum  market.  Rarely  does  one  hear  talk  of  "platinum  bugs",  rants  about  how  every  society  on  Earth  has  valued  platinum  as  the  One  True  Valuable  Thing  (tm),  or  seen  presidential  candidates  call  for  the  return  to  the  platinum  standard.
491482	Why  Investors  Buy  Platinum  is  an  old  (1995)  article  but  still  interesting  to  understand  the  answer  to  your  question.
3312	The  link  you  originally  included  had  an  affiliate  code  included  (now  removed).  It  is  likely  that  your  "friend"  suggested  the  site  to  you  because  there  is  something  in  it  for  your  "friend"  if  you  sign  up  with  their  link.  Seek  independent  financial  advice,  not  from  somebody  trying  to  earn  a  commission  off  you.  Don't  trust  everything  you  read  online  –  again,  the  advice  may  be  biased.    Many  of  the  online  "reviews"  for  Regal  Assets  look  like  excuses  to  post  affiliate  links.  A  handful  of  the  highly-ranked  (by  Google  Search)  "reviews"  about  this  company  even  obscure  their  links  to  this  company  using  HTTP  redirects.  Whenever  I  see  this  practice  in  a  "review"  for  a  web  site,  I  have  to  ask  if  it  is  to  try  and  appear  more  independent  by  hiding  the  affiliation?  Gold  and  other  precious  metal  commodities  can  be  part  of  a  diversified  portfolio,  a  small  part  with  some  value  as  a  hedge,  but  IMHO  it  isn't  prudent  to  put  all  your  eggs  in  that  basket.  Look  up  the  benefits  of  diversification.    It  isn't  hard  to  find  compelling  evidence  in  favor  of  the  practice.    You  should  also  look  up  the  benefits  of  low-fee  passively-managed  index  funds.  A  self-directed  IRA  with  a  reputable  broker  can  give  you  access  to  a  wide  selection  of  low-fee  funds,  not  just  a  single  risky  asset  class.
315286	Advantages  of  Gold  IRA  (regardless  of  where  you're  holding  it):  Disadvantages  of  Gold  IRA:  Instead,  you  can  invest  in  trust  funds  like  SLV  (The  ETF  for  silver)  or  GLD  in  your  regular  brokerage  IRA.  These  funds  negotiate  their  prices  of  storage,  are  relatively  liquid,  and  shield  you  from  the  dangers  of  owning  physical  metal  while  providing  opportunity  to  invest  in  it  at  market  prices.
24668	First,  the  annual  report  is  just  that,  a  snapshot  that  shows  value  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  period.  Beginning  =  Aug  08  =  $105B  End  =              Aug  09  =    $89B  Newsletter  date  May  10  =  $96B  Odd  they  chose  end  of  August  as  it's  not  even  a  calendar  quarter  end.  The  $16B  was  market  loss  during  that  period.  Nearly  half  of  that  seemed  to  be  recovered  by  the  time  this  newsletter  came  out.  The  balance  sheet  also  has  to  show  deposits  and  payments  made  to  existing  retirees.  I  haven't  looked  at  the  S&P  numbers  for  those  dates,  but  my  gut  says  this  is  right.  The  market  tanked  and  the  plan  was  down,  but  not  too  bad.    Protect?  The  PBGC  guarantees  pensions  up  to  a  certain  limit.  I  believe  that  in  general,  teachers  are  below  the  limit  and  are  not  at  risk  of  a  reduced  benefit.  You  do  need  to  check  that  your  plan  is  covered.  If  not,  I  believe  the  state  would  take  over  directly.  I  hope  this  helps.
228211	Because  giving  someone  a  loan  and  paying  them  to  take  it  isn't  a  loan  anymore.    I'll  grant  you,  some  of  the  treasury  bill  auctions  did  slip  below  0%  --  people  paid  in  slightly  more  than  what  the  bill  would  pay  out.  In  as  much  as  this  was  done  by  actual  investors  (and  not  afore-mentioned  helicopter  Ben  Bernanke  keeping  the  printing  presses  running  hot  all  night),  it  was  major  accounts  fearful  of  the  euro  disintegrating  and  banks  crashing,  and  so  on,  and  needing  a  safe  spot  to  stick  their  cash  for  a  couple  months.    Where  the  Fed  is  concerned,  that  interest  rate  he's  referring  to  is  lending  they  do  to  banks.  So,  how  much  would  you  take  if  you  ran  a  bank  and  the  Fed  offered  to  pay  you  to  take  their  money?  A  billion?  A  trillion?  As  much  as  you  could  cram  in  your  vaults,  shove  in  your  pockets,  and  stuff  down  your  favorite  teller's  blouse?  Yea,  me  too.
133486	Keep  in  mind  that  the  Federal  Reserve  Chairman  needs  to  be  very  careful  with  his  use  of  words.    Here's  what  he  said:  It  is  arguable  that  interest  rates  are  too  high,  that  they  are  being  constrained  by  the  fact  that  interest  rates  can't  go  below  zero.  We  have  an  economy  where  demand  falls  far  short  of  the  capacity  of  the  economy  to  produce.  We  have  an  economy  where  the  amount  of  investment  in  durable  goods  spending  is  far  less  than  the  capacity  of  the  economy  to  produce.  That  suggests  that  interest  rates  in  some  sense  should  be  lower  rather  than  higher.  We  can't  make  interest  rates  lower,  of  course.  (They)  only  can  go  down  to  zero.  And  again  I  would  argue  that  a  healthy  economy  with  good  returns  is  the  best  way  to  get  returns  to  savers.  So  what  does  that  mean?  When  he  says  that  "we  can't  make  interest  rates  lower",  that  doesn't  mean  that  it  isn't  possible.  He's  saying  that  our  demand  for  goods  is  lower  than  our  ability  to  produce  them.  Negative  interest  would  actually  make  that  problem  worse  --  if  I  know  that  things  will  cost  less  in  a  month,  I'm  not  going  to  buy  anything.  The  Fed  is  incentivizing  spending  by  lowering  the  cost  of  capital  to  zero.  By  continuing  this  policy,  they  are  eventually  going  to  bring  on  inflation,  which  will  reduce  the  value  of  the  currency  --  which  gives  people  and  companies  that  are  sitting  on  money  an  dis-incentive  to  continue  hoarding  it.
553293	If  the  Federal  Reserve  were  to  pay  banks  to  hold  money,  they  would  need  to  get  the  money  from  somewhere  to  do  so.    They  would  have  three  options:  Go  to  Congress,  and  request  and  authorization  of  funds.  As  an  quasi-independent  entity,  however,  it  would  be  both  highly  unorthodox  for  an  institution  to  diminish  its  own  authority  by  requesting  funding,  and  politically  difficult  for  the  Congress  to  appropriate  it.  Transfer  held-assets    After  QE  &  QE2,  the  Fed  is  now  the  holder  of  several  assets  (mortgages  and  the  like)  that  are  already  unorthodox  for  it  to  hold.  It  acquired  these  assets  in  the  first  place  to  soak  up  excess  demand.    If  these  assets  were  transferred  back  to  banks,  it  would  have  exactly  the  opposite  effect  -  increasing  supply  and  further  suppressing  the  value  of  the  assets  they  would  be  trying  to  shore  up  by  lowering  the  interest  rate.  "Print  money"    The  fed  could  raise  the  money  supply  by  issuing  new  bonds.  This  is  inherently  inflationary,  and  while  pretty  much  everyone  agrees  this  isn't  bad  in  the  short  run,  there  is  already  widespread  fear  that  in  the  long  run,  QE  by  itself  is  going  to  unleash  massive  inflation  once  growth  returns  anyway.    To  keep  "pushing  on  this  string"  would  only  excerabate  these  fears,  and  quite  likely  turn  it  into  a  self-fufilling  prophecy.  In  short,  the  Fed  "could"  pay  banks  to  hold  money,  but  the  political  and  economic  consequences  of  raising  the  needed  funds  to  do  so  would  all  undermine  the  institution  or  the  desired  effect.
425288	Why  can't  the  Fed  simply  bid  more  than  the  bond's  maturity  value  to  lower  interest  rates  below  zero?  The  FED  could  do  this  but  then  it  would  have  to  buy  all  the  bonds  in  the  market  since  all  other  market  participants  would  not  be  willing  to  lend  money  to  the  government  only  to  receive  less  money  back  in  the  future.    Not  everyone  has  the  ability  to  print  unlimited  amounts  of  dollars  :)
354553	That  is  kind  of  the  point,  one  of  the  hopes  is  that  it  incentivizes  banks  to  stop  storing  money  and  start  injecting  it  into  the  economy  themselves.  Compared  to  the  European  Central  Bank  investing  directly  into  the  economy  the  way  the  US  central  bank  has  been  doing.  (The  Federal  Reserve  buying  mortgage  backed  securities)  On  a  country  level,  individual  European  countries  have  tried  this  before  in  recent  times  with  no  noticeable  effect.
142536	Problems  with  your  plan  (in  no  particular  order)  there  is  a  limit,  once  they  have  decided  that  you  have  enough  credit  they  won't  offer  any  more.  If  the  economy  changes  (like  it  did  in  2008)  they  can  reduce  the  limit  on  existing  accounts.  If  you  don't  use  them,  they  may  decide  to  close  them.  Using  existing  cards  will  encourage  the  bank  to  increase  the  limit  on  that  card.  opening  cards  can  make  some  lenders  nervous.  Having  a  new  card  close  to  when  you  are  applying  for  a  mortgage  or  a  car  loan  can  make  them  less  likely  to  lend  you  the  max.  You  have  to  decide:  Are  you  trying  to  buildup  your  credit  limit?  or  your  credit  score?
339030	I  disagree  with  the  reply.      Your  both  impressions  are  correct.  -      Do  not  close  old  credit  cards  because  they  keep  your  credit  rating  high  (fico  score)  -      Also  low  utilization  that  credit  cards  report  to  credit  rating  companies,  improves  your  rating.
496080	Your  plan  will  work  to  increase  your  total  credit  capacity  (good  for  your  credit  score)  and  reduce  your  utilization  (also  good).    As  mentioned,  you  will  need  to  be  careful  to  use  these  cards  periodically  or  they  will  get  closed,  but  it  will  work.  The  question  is  whether  this  will  help  you  or  not.    In  addition  to  credit  capacity  and  utilization,  your  credit  score  looks  at  things  like  These  factors  may  hurt  you  as  you  continue  to  open  accounts.    You  can  easily  get  to  the  stage  where  your  score  is  not  benefitting  much  from  increased  capacity  and  it  is  getting  hurt  a  lot  by  pulls  and  low  average  age.  BTW  you  are  correct  that  closing  accounts  generally  hurts  your  score.    It  probably  reduces  average  age,  may  reduce  maximum  age,  reduces  your  capacity,  and  increases  your  utilization.
450228	Never  invest  money  you  need  in  the  short  term.  As  already  suggested,  park  your  money  in  CDs.
104724	Books  such  as  "The  Pocket  Idiot's  Guide  to  Investing  in  Mutual  Funds"  claim  that  money  market  funds  and  CDs  are  the  most  prudent  things  to  invest  in  if  you  need  the  money  within  5  years.  More  specifically:
453625	Are  you  going  to  South  Africa  or  from?    (Looking  on  your  profile  for  this  info.)  If  you're  going  to  South  Africa,  you  could  do  worse  than  to  buy  five  or  six  one-ounce  krugerrands.    Maybe  wait  until  next  year  to  buy  a  few;  you  may  get  a  slightly  better  deal.  Not  only  is  it  gold,  it's  minted  by  that  country,  so  it's  easier  to  liquidate  should  you  need  to.    Plus,  they  go  for  a  smaller  premium  in  the  US  than  some  other  forms  of  gold.  As  for  the  rest  of  the  $100k,  I  don't  know  ...  either  park  it  in  CD  ladders  or  put  it  in  something  that  benefits  if  the  economy  gets  worse.  (Cheery,  ain't  I?  ;)  )
573713	If  you  ever  need  the  money  in  three  years,  imagine  that  today  is  2006  and  you  need  the  money  in  2009.    Keep  it  in  savings  accounts,  money-markets,  or  CDs  maturing  at  the  right  time.
487817	Investing  $100k  into  physical  gold  (bars  or  coins)  is  the  most  prudent  option;  given  the  state  of  economic  turmoil  worldwide.    Take  a  look  at  the  long  term  charts;  they're  pretty  self  explanatory.      Gold  has  an  upward  trend  for  100+  years.    http://www.goldbuyguide.com/price/  A  more  high  risk/high  reward  investment  would  be  to  buy  $100k  of  physical  silver.    Silver  has  a  similar  track  record  and  inherent  benefits  of  gold.    Yet,  with  a  combination  of  factors  that  could  make  it  even  more  bull  than  gold  (ie-  better  liquidity,  industrial  demand).      Beyond  that,  you  may  want  to  look  at  other  commodities  such  as  oil  and  agriculture.    The  point  is,  this  is  troubled  times  for  worldwide  economies.    Times  like  this  you  want  to  invest  in  REAL  things  like  commodities  or  companies  that  are  actually  producing  essential  materials.
369202	I  don't  believe  there  is  any  particular  structural  or  financial  reason  that  outgoing  wire  transfers  cost  so  much  in  Canada,  their  costs  are  no  higher  than  other  countries  (and  lower  than  many).    Wires  seem  to  be  an  area  where  the  Canadian  banks  have  decided  people  don't  comparison  shop,  so  it's  not  a  competitive  advantage  to  offer  a  better  price.  The  rates  you  quoted  are  on  the  low  side:  $80  for  a  largish  international  wire  is  not  unusual,  and  HSBC  charges  up  to  $150!  There  are  several  alternative  ways  to  transfer  money  domestically  in  Canada.  If  the  recipient  banks  at  the  same  bank,  it's  possible  to  go  into  a  branch  and  transfer  money  directly  from  your  own  account  to  their  account  (I've  never  been  charged  for  this).    The  transfer  is  immediate.    But  it  couldn't  be  done  online,  last  time  I  checked.  For  transfers  where  you  don't  know  the  recipients  bank  account,  you  can  pay  online  with  Interac  E-Transfers,  offered  by  most  Canadian  banks.    It's  basically  e-mailing  money.    It  usually  costs  $1  to  $1.50  per  transfer,  and  has  limits  on  how  much  you  can  send  per  day/week.  Each  of  the  banks  also  have  a  bill-pay  service,  but  unlike  similar  services  in  the  US  (where  they  mail  a  paper  check  if  the  recipient  isn't  on  their  system),  each  Canadian  bank  has  a  limited  number  of  possible  payees  (mostly  utilities,  governments,  major  stores).
98096	because  bankers  are  crooks  is  a  very  close  answer.  Just  accept  the  truth  that  financial  industry  is  the  only  service  industry  that  could  turn  into  giant  parasite  chopping  pieces  from  real  economy.  I  am  not  anti-financial,  because  greed  is  not  banker's  fault,  but  just  one  significant  part  of  human  nature.  Every  human  being  has  greed  and  fear  built  in  it.  But  financial  industry  is  the  only  one  which  is  built  on  exploiting  greed  and  fear.  Governments  are  throwing  gasoline  canister  into  that  fire  in  desperate  extinguish  attempts,  trying  to  "regulate"  but  only  making  it  worse.  With  all  that  "counter-cybercrime",  "counter-terrorism"  and  "counter-everything"  efforts,  ordinary  people  will  be  hurt  as  always.
487502	Transaction  fees  are  part  of  the  income  for  banks,  and  as  we  know  they  are  profit  making  corporations  just  like  any  other  Company.  The  differene  is  that  instead  of  buying  and  packing  and  Selling  groceries,  they  buy  and  package  and  sell  Money.  Within  the  rules  and  the  market  they  will  try  to  maximize  their  profit,  exactly  like  Apple  or  GM  or  Walmart  and  so  on.  Sweden  and  Holland  are  part  of  the  European  union  and  the  leaders  of  the  union  has  defined  (by  law)  that  certain  types  of  transactions  should  be  done  without  fees.  In  order  to  transfer  Money  from  your  Swedish  account  to  the  Dutch  account  you  do  what  is  called  a  SEPA  transaction,  which  should  be  done  in  one  day  without  cost  to  you  as  a  customer.

180838	I  don't  know  of  a  guideline  to  how  often  you  can  ask  for  an  increase.  You  can  ask  as  often  as  you  like.  As  for  consequences,  refer  to  Is  there  a  downside  to  asking  for  a  credit  increase?,  where  the  consensus  is  that,  aside  from  a  possible  (temporary)  hard  pull  on  your  credit  report,  there's  probably  no  risk  to  asking.  Depending  on  your  credit  score/history,  and  especially  in  the  current  economy,  you  may  get  "no"  as  an  answer  most  often.  You  can  try  talking  to  your  card's  Credit  Department  or  even  Customer  Retention  Department  as  they  may  have  more  leverage.  They  may  say  yes  or  no  or  that  they  need  to  review  your  account.  When  you  do  ask  for  an  increase,  I  would  make  sure  to  ask  if  there  will  be  a  hard  pull  on  your  report,  if  there  is  any  cost  or  downside  to  applying,  and  to  make  sure  that  this  would  be  an  increase  to  your  current  credit  line,  not  a  new  account.
110953	I  do  this  all  the  time,  my  credit  rating  over  time  plotted  on  a  graph  looks  like  saw  blades  going  upward  on  a  slope  I  use  a  credit  alert  service  to  get  my  credit  reports  quarterly,  and  I  know  when  the  credit  agencies  update  their  files  (every  three  months),  so  I  never  have  a  high  balance  at  those  particular  times  Basically,  I  use  the  negative  hard  pulls  to  propel  my  credit  score  upwards  with  a  the  consequentially  lowered  credit  utilization  ratio,  and  the  credit  history.  So  here  is  how  it  works  for  me,  but  I  am  not  an  impulse  buyer  and  I  wouldn't  recommend  it  for  most  people  as  I  have  seen  spending  habits:  Month  1:  charge  cards,  pay  minimum  balance  (raises  score  multiple  points)  Month  2:  PAY  OFF  ALL  CREDIT  CARDS,  massive  deleveraging  using  actual  money  I  already  have  (raises  score  multiple  points)  Month  3:  get  credit  report  showing  low  balance,  charge  cards,  pay  minimum  balance  ask  for  extensions  of  credit,  AND  followup  on  new  credit  line  offers  (lowers  score  several  points  per  credit  inquiry)  Month  4:  charge  cards,  pay  minimum  balance,  discretionally  approving  hard  pulls  -  always  have  room  for  one  or  two  random  hard  pulls,  such  as  for  a  new  cell  phone  contract,  or  renting  a  car,  or  employment,  etc  Month  5:  PAY  OFF  CREDIT  CARDS  using  actual  money  you  have.  (the  trick  is  to  NEVER  really  go  above  a  15%  credit  utilization  ratio,  and  to  never  overleverage.  Tricky  because  very  quickly  you  will  get  enough  credit  to  go  bankrupt)  Month  6:  get  credit  report  showing  low  balances,  a  slight  dip  in  score  from  last  quarter,  but  still  high  continue.
571198	I  think  you're  right  that  from  a  pure  "expected  future  value"  perspective,  it  makes  sense  to  pay  this  loan  off  as  quickly  as  possible  (including  not  taking  the  next  year's  loan).  The  new  student  loans  with  the  higher  interest  rates  have  changed  the  balance  enough  that  it's  no  longer  automatically  better  to  keep  it  going  as  long  as  possible.  The  crucial  point  in  your  case,  which  isn't  true  for  many  people,  is  that  you  will  likely  have  to  pay  it  off  eventually  anyway  and  so  in  terms  of  net  costs  over  your  lifetime  you  will  do  best  by  paying  it  off  quickly.  A  few  points  to  set  against  that,  that  you  might  want  to  consider:  Not  paying  it  off  is  a  good  hedge  against  your  career  not  going  as  well  as  you  expect,  e.g.  if  the  economy  does  badly,  you  have  health  problems,  you  take  a  career  break  for  any  reason.  If  that  happens,  you  would  end  up  not  being  forced  to  pay  it  off,  so  will  end  up  gaining  from  not  having  done  so  voluntarily.  The  money  you  save  in  that  case  could  be  more  valuable  to  you  that  the  money  you  would  lose  if  your  career  does  go  well.  Not  paying  it  off  will  increase  your  net  cash  earlier  in  life  when  you  are  more  likely  to  need  it,  e.g.  for  a  house  deposit.  Having  more  free  cash  could  increase  your  options,  making  it  possible  to  buy  a  house  earlier  in  life.  Or  it  could  mean  you  have  a  higher  deposit  when  you  do  buy,  reducing  the  interest  rate  on  the  entire  mortgage  balance.  The  savings  from  that  could  end  up  being  more  than  the  6%  interest  on  the  loan  even  though  when  you  look  at  the  loan  in  isolation  it  seems  like  a  very  bad  rate.
370281	I  went  to  Morningstar's  "Performance"  page  for  FUSEX  (Fideltiy's  S&P  500  index  fund)  and  used  the  "compare"  tool  to  compare  it  with  FOSFX  and  FWWFX,  as  well  as  FEMKX  (Fidelity  Emerging  Markets  fund).    According  to  the  data  there,  FOSFX  outperformed  FUSEX  in  2012,  FEMKX  outperformed  FUSED  in  2010,  and  FWWFX  outperformed  FUSEX  in  both  2010  and  2012.    When  looking  at  10-  and  15-year  trailing  returns,  both  FEMKX  and  FWWFX  outperformed  FUSEX.  What  does  this  mean?    It  means  it  matters  what  time  period  you're  looking  at.    US  stocks  have  been  on  an  almost  unbroken  increase  since  early  2009.    It's  not  surprising  that  if  you  look  at  recent  returns,  international  markets  will  not  stack  up  well.    If  you  go  back  further,  though,  you  can  find  periods  where  international  funds  outperformed  the  US;  and  even  within  recent  years,  there  have  been  individual  years  where  international  funds  won.  As  for  correlation,  I  guess  it  depends  what  you  mean  by  "low".    According  to  this  calculator,  for  instance,  FOSFX  and  FUSEX  had  a  correlation  of  about  0.84  over  the  last  15  years.    That  may  seem  high,  but  it's  still  lower  than,  say,  the  0.91  correlation  between  FUSEX  and  FSLCX  (Fideltiy  Small  Cap).    It's  difficult  to  find  truly  low  correlations  among  equity  funds,  since  the  interconnectedness  of  the  global  economy  means  that  bull  and  bear  markets  tend  to  spread  from  one  country  to  another.    To  get  lower  correlations  you  need  to  look  at  different  asset  classes  (e.g.,  bonds).  So  the  answer  is  basically  that  some  of  the  funds  you  were  already  looking  at  may  be  the  ones  you  were  looking  for.    The  trick  is  that  no  category  will  outperform  any  other  over  all  periods.    That's  exactly  what  volatility  means  ---  it  means  the  same  category  that  overperforms  in  some  periods  will  underperform  in  others.    If  international  funds  always  outperformed,  no  one  would  ever  buy  US  funds.    Ultimately,  if  you're  trying  to  decide  on  investments  for  yourself,  you  need  to  take  all  this  information  into  account  and  combine  it  with  your  own  personal  preferences,  risk  tolerance,  etc.  Anecdotally,  I  recently  did  some  simulation-based  analyses  of  Vanguard  funds  using  data  from  the  past  15  years.    Over  this  period,  Vanguard's  emerging  markets  fund  (VEIEX)  comes  out  far  ahead  of  US  funds,  and  is  also  the  least-correlated  with  the  S&P  500.    But,  again,  this  analysis  is  based  only  on  a  particular  slice  of  time.
365295	Tricky  question,  basically,  you  just  want  to  first  spread  risk  around,  and  then  seek  abnormal  returns  after  you  understand  what  portions  of  your  portfolio  are  influenced  by  (and  understand  your  own  investment  goals)  For  a  relevant  timely  example:  the  German  stock  exchange  and  it's  equity  prices  are  reaching  all  time  highs,  while  the  Greek  asset  prices  are  reaching  all  time  lows.  If  you  just  invested  in  "Europe"  your  portfolio  will  experience  only  the  mean,  while  suffering  from  exchange  rate  changes.  You  will  likely  lose  because  you  arbitrarily  invested  internationally,  for  the  sake  of  being  international,  instead  of  targeting  a  key  country  or  sector.  Just  boils  down  to  more  research  for  you,  if  you  want  to  be  a  passive  investor  you  will  get  passive  investor  returns.  I'm  not  personally  familiar  with  funds  that  are  good  at  taking  care  of  this  part  for  you,  in  the  international  markets.
562061	Here's  the  2009-2014  return  of  the  S&P  500  (SPY)  vs.  Vanguard  FTSE  ex-US  (VEU)  (higher  returns  bolded)  Another  argument  for  them  is  their  low  correlation  to  U.S  stocks.      Looking  at  history  however,  I  don't  see  it.  Most  times  U.S  stocks  have      done  badly,  foreign  stocks  have  also  done  badly.  Looking  at  the  last  6  years  (and  current  YTD),  1  in  3  years  have  international  stocks  doing  better.        I  invest  a  portion  of  my  investments  in  international  because  they  aren't  well  correlated.
79275	Foreign  stocks  tend  to  be  more  volatile  --  higher  risk  trades  off  against  higher  return  potential,  always.  The  better  reason  for  having  some  money  in  that  area  is  that,  as  with  bonds,  it  moves  out-of-sync  with  the  US  markets  and  once  you  pick  your  preferred  distribution,  maintaining  that  balance  semi-automatically  takes  advantage  of  that  to  improve  your  return-vs-risk  position.  I  have  a  few  percent  of  my  total  investments  in  an  international  stock  index  fund,  and  a  few  percent  in  an  international  REIT,  both  being  fairly  low-fee.  (Low  fees  mean  more  of  the  money  reaches  you,  and  seems  to  be  one  of  the  better  reasons  for  preferring  one  fund  over  another  following  the  same  segment  of  the  market.)  They're  there  because  the  model  my  investment  advisor  uses  --  and  validated  with  monte-carlo  simulation  of  my  specific  mix  --  shows  that  keeping  them  in  the  mix  at  this  low  level  is  likely  to  result  in  a  better  long-term  outcome  than  if  i  left  them  out.  No  guarantees,  but  probabilities  lean  toward  this  specfic  mix  doing  what  i  need.  I  don't  pretend  to  be  able  to  justify  that  via  theory  or  to  explain  why  these  specific  ratios  work...  but  I  understand  enough  about  the  process  to  trust  that  they  are  on  (perhaps  of  many)  reasonable  solutions  to  get  the  best  odds  given  my  specific  risk  tolerance,  timeline,  and  distaste  for  actively  managing  my  money  more  than  a  few  times  a  year.  If  that.
92403	You  want  to  buy  a  house  for  $150,000.    It  may  be  possible  to  do  this  with  $10,000  and  a  3.5%  downpayment,  but  it  would  be  a  lot  better  to  have  $40,000  and  make  a  20%  downpayment.    That  would  give  you  a  cushion  in  case  house  prices  fall,  and  there  are  often  advantages  to  a  20%  downpayment  (lower  rate;  less  mandatory  insurance).      You  have  an  income  of  $35,000  and  expenses  of  $23,000  (if  you  are  careful  with  the  money--what  if  you  aren't?).    You  should  have  savings  of  either  $17,500  or  $11,500  in  case  of  emergencies.    Perhaps  you  simply  weren't  mentioning  that.    Note  that  you  also  need  at  least  $137  *  26  =  $3562  more  to  cover  mortgage  payments,  so  $15,062  by  the  expenses  standard.    This  is  in  addition  to  the  $40,000  for  downpayment  and  closing  costs.      What  do  you  plan  to  do  if  there  is  a  problem  with  the  new  house,  e.g.  you  need  a  new  roof?    Or  smaller  expenses  like  a  new  furnace  or  appliance?    A  plumbing  problem?    Damages  from  a  storm?    What  if  the  tenants'  teenage  child  has  a  party  and  trashes  the  place?    What  if  your  tenants  stop  paying  rent  but  refuse  to  move  out,  trashing  the  place  while  being  evicted?    Your  emergency  savings  need  to  be  able  to  cover  those  situations.      You  checked  comps  (comparable  properties).    Great!    But  notice  that  you  are  looking  at  a  one  bathroom  property  for  $150,000  and  comparing  to  $180,000  houses.    Consider  that  you  may  not  get  the  $235  for  that  house,  which  is  cheaper.    Perhaps  the  rent  for  that  house  will  only  be  $195  or  less,  because  one  bathroom  doesn't  really  support  three  bedrooms  of  people.      While  real  estate  can  be  part  of  a  portfolio,  balance  would  suggest  that  much  more  of  your  portfolio  be  in  things  like  stocks  and  bonds.    What  are  you  doing  for  retirement?    Are  you  maxing  out  any  tax-advantaged  options  that  you  have  available?    It  might  be  better  to  do  that  before  entering  the  real  estate  market.      I  am  a  23  year  old  Australian  man  with  a  degree  in  computer  science  and  a  steady  job  from  home  working  as  a  web  developer.  I'm  a  bit  unclear  on  this.    What  makes  the  job  steady?    Is  it  employment  with  a  large  company?    Are  you  self-employed  with  what  has  been  a  steady  flow  of  customers?    Regardless  of  which  it  is,  consider  the  possibility  of  a  recession.    The  company  can  lay  you  off  (presumably  you  are  at  the  bottom  of  the  seniority).    The  new  customers  may  be  reluctant  to  start  new  projects  while  their  cash  flow  is  restrained.    And  your  tenants  may  move  out.    At  the  same  time.    What  will  you  do  then?      A  mortgage  is  an  obligation.    You  have  to  pay  it  regardless.    While  currently  flush,  are  you  the  kind  of  flush  that  can  weather  a  major  setback?    I  would  feel  a  lot  better  about  an  investment  like  this  if  you  had  $600,000  in  savings  and  were  using  this  as  a  complementary  investment  to  broaden  your  portfolio.    Even  if  you  had  $60,000  in  savings  and  would  still  have  substantial  savings  after  the  purchase.    This  feels  more  like  you  are  trying  to  maximize  your  purchase.    Money  burning  a  hole  in  your  pocket  and  trying  to  escape.      It  would  be  a  lot  safer  to  stick  to  securities.    The  worst  that  happens  there  is  that  you  lose  your  investment  (and  it's  more  likely  that  the  value  will  be  reduced  but  recover).    With  mortgages,  you  can  lose  your  entire  investment  and  then  some.    Yes,  the  price  may  recover,  but  it  may  do  so  after  the  bank  forecloses  on  the  mortgage.
507029	In  general  people  make  a  few  key  mistakes  with  property:  1)  Not  factoring  in  depreciation  properly.  Houses  are  perpetually  falling  down,  and  if  you  are  renting  them  perpetually  being  trashed  by  the  tenants  as  well  -  particularly  in  bad  areas.  Accurate  depreciation  costs  can  often  run  in  the  5-20%  range  per  year  depending  on  the  property/area.  Add  insurance  to  this  as  well.  2)  Related  to  1),  they  take  the  index  price  of  house  price  rises  as  something  they  can  achieve,  when  in  reality  a  lot  of  the  house  price  'rise'  is  just  everyone  having  to  spend  a  lot  of  money  keeping  them  standing  up.  No  investor  can  actually  track  a  house  price  graph  due  to  1)  so  be  careful  to  make  reasonable  assumptions  about  actual  achievable  future  growth.    3)  Failure  to  price  in  the  huge  transaction  costs  (often  5%+  per  sale)  and  capital  gains/other  taxes  (depends  on  the  exact  tax  structure  where  you  are).  These  add  up  very  fast  if  you  are  buying  and  selling  at  all  frequently.  4)  Costs  in  either  time  or  fees  to  real  estate  rental  agents.  Having  to  fill,  check,  evict,  fix  and  maintain  rental  properties  is  a  lot  more  work  than  most  people  realise,  and  you  either  have  to  pay  this  in  your  own  time  or  someone  else’s.  Again,  has  to  be  factored  in.  5)  Liquidity  issues.  Selling  houses  in  down  markets  is  very,  very  hard.  They  are  not  like  stocks  where  they  can  be  moved  quickly.  Houses  can  often  sit  on  the  market  for  years  before  sale  if  you  are  not  prepared  to  take  low  prices.  As  the  bank  owns  your  house  if  you  fail  to  pay  the  mortgage  (rents  collapse,  loss  of  job  etc)  they  can  force  you  to  fire  sale  it  leaving  you  in  a  whole  world  of  pain  depending  on  the  exact  legal  system  (negative  equity  etc).  These  factors  are  generally  correlated  if  you  work  in  the  same  cities  you  are  buying  in  so  quite  a  lot  of  potential  long  tail  risk  if  the  regional  economy  collapses.  6)  Finally,  if  you’re  young  they  can  tie  you  to  areas  where  your  earnings  potential  is  limited.  Renting  can  be  immensely  beneficial  early  on  in  a  career  as  it  gives  you  huge  freedom  to  up  sticks  and  leave  fast  when  new  opportunities  arise.  Locking  yourself  into  20yr+  contracts/activities  when  young  can  be  hugely  inhibiting  to  your  earnings  potential  –  particularly  in  fast  moving  jobs  like  software  development.    Without  more  details  on  the  exact  legal  framework,  area,  house  type  etc  it’s  hard  to  give  more  specific  advise,  but  in  general  you  need  a  very  large  margin  of  safety  with  property  due  to  all  of  the  above,  so  if  the  numbers  you’re  running  are  coming  out  close,  it’s  probably  not  worth  it,  and  you’re  better  of  sticking  with  more  hands  off  investments  like  stocks  and  bonds.
520563	I  would  strongly,  strongly  advise  against  it.  Others  here  are  answering  the  question  of,  having  decided  to  invest  in  property,  how  one  ought  to  ensure  that  one  invests  in  the  right  property.  What  has  not  really  been  discussed  here  is  the  issue  of  diversification.  There  are  a  number  of  serious  risks  to  property  investment.  In  fact,  it  is  one  of  the  riskiest  types  of  investment.  You  face  more  of  almost  every  type  of  risk  in  property  than  maybe  any  other  asset  class.  It  is  one  thing  to  take  on  those  risks  as  part  of  a  diverse  portfolio  including  other  asset  classes.  It  is  quite  another  -  extremely  irresponsible  -  thing  to  take  on  those  risks  as  your  sole  investment,  when  your  portfolio  is  in  its  infancy.  So  no,  do  not  invest  in  property  when  you  lack  any  other  investments.  Absolutely  not.
222914	I  want  to  caveat  that  I  am  not  an  active  investor  in  Australia,  you  most  likely  should  seek  out  other  investors  in  your  market  and  ask  them  for  advice/mentorship,  but  since  you  came  here  I  can  give  you  some  generalized  advice.    When  investing  in  real  estate  there  are  a  two  main  rules  of  thumb  to  quickly  determine  if  the  property  will  be  a  good  investment.  The  50%  rule  and  the  2%  (or  1%)  rule.      The  50%  rules  says  that  in  general  50%  if  the  income  from  the  property  will  go  to  expenses  not  including  debt  service.    If  you  are  bringing  in  $1000  a  month  500  of  that  will  go  to  utilities,  taxes,  repair,  capital  expenditures,  advertising,  lawn  care,  etc.  That  leave  you  with  500  to  pay  the  mortgage  and  if  anything  is  left  that  can  be  cash  flow.    As  this  is  your  first  property  and  it  is  in  "  a  relatively  bad  neighbourhood"  you  might  consider  bumping  that  up  to  60%  just  to  make  sure  you  have  padding.  The  1  or  2%  rules  says  that  the  monthly  rent  should  be  1(or  2)  percent  of  the  purchase  price  in  this  case  the  home  is  bought  at  150,000.    If  the  rent  is  1,500  a  month  it  might  be  a  good  investment  but  if  it  rents  for  3,000  a  month  it  probably  is  a  good  investment.    There  are  other  factors  to  consider  if  a  home  meets  the  2%  rule  it  might  be  in  a  rough  neighborhood  which  increases  turnover  which  in  general  is  the  biggest  expense  in  an  investment  property.    If  a  property  meets  one  or  both  of  these  rules  you  should  take  a  closer  look  at  it  and  with  proper  due  diligence  determine  that  it  is  a  deal.    These  rules  are  just  hard  and  fast  guidelines  to  property  analysis,  they  may  need  to  be  adapted  to  you  market.    For  example  these  rules  will  not  hold  in  most  (all?)  big  cities.
549798	According  to  the  following  links,  it  is  commonly  pronounced  "Cecil".      https://kaufmanrossin.com/blog/bank-ready-meet-cecil/  The  proposed  model  introduces  the  concept  of  shifting  from  an  incurred      loss  model  to  the  current  expected  credit  loss  model  commonly  referred      to  as  CECL  (pronounced  “Cecil”).  http://www.gonzobanker.com/2016/02/cecl-the-blind-leading-the-blurry/  [...]  and  its  name  is  CECL  (Current  Estimated  Credit  Losses,  pronounced  like      the  name  “Cecil”).  The  name  Cecil  means  “blind,”  which  is  ironic,  because  FASB’s  upcoming      guidance  will  push  FIs  to  clarify  the  future  performance  of  their  loan      portfolios  by  using  models  to  predict  CECL  of  all  loan  portfolios.  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/operational-financial-impact-cecl-banks-nikhil-deshmukh  Termed  as  Current  Expected  Credit  Loss  (CECL,  or  Cecil,  as  some  call      it),  [...]
45665	We  use  YNAB  to  handle  our  household  budget  -  their  latest  version  allows  cloud  sync  between  Android/iOS  devices  and  various  desktop  installs.    I  have  the  budget  folder  shared  with  my  wife's  Dropbox  account  so  we  both  an  view  the  budget,  enter  spending,  and  make  changes.
425738	We  use  mint  for  just  that.  We  have  a  "shared"  account.  We  each  have  the  mobile  app  and  share  the  same  pin  for  the  application  (not  our  phones  --  you  can  set  a  pin  in  the  settings  on  the  application).  Thus  we  each  share  a  login  to  the  site,  where  we  have  setup  all  of  our  accounts.  In  the  "Your  Profile"  link  at  the  top  of  the  page,  you  may  select  the  Email  &  Alerts  option.  From  here  you  may  add  a  second  e-mail  account.  This  way  if  you  go  over  a  budget  or  have  a  bill  upcoming  each  of  you  will  get  a  notification.  We  have  setup  budgeting  through  the  web  site,  and  either  of  us  can  modify  the  budget  via  logging  in.
19258	The  best  solution  I've  been  able  to  find  for  this  is  MoneyWiz,  where  both  are  logged  into  the  same  sync  account.
212390	If  you  are  interested  in  a  career  in  algorithmic  trading,  I  strongly  encourage  you  to  formally  study  math  and  computer  science.    Algorithmic  trading  firms  have  no  need  for  employees  with  financial  knowledge;  if  they  did,  they'd  just  be  called  "trading"  firms.    Rather,  they  need  experts  in  machine  learning,  statistical  modeling,  and  computer  science  in  general.  Of  course  there  are  other  avenues  of  employment  at  an  algorithmic  trading  firm,  such  as  accounting,  clearing,  exchange  relations,  etc.    If  that's  the  sort  of  thing  you're  interested  in,  again  you'll  probably  want  a  formal  education  in  those  areas  as  opposed  to  just  reading  about  finance  in  the  news.  If  you  edit  your  question  or  add  a  comment  below  with  information  about  your  particular  background,  I  could  perhaps  advise  you  in  a  bit  more  detail.  ::edit::  Given  your  comment,  I  would  say  you  have  a  fine  academic  background  for  the  industry.    When  hiring  mathematicians,  firms  care  most  about  the  ease  with  which  you  can  explore  and  extract  features  from  massive  datasets  (especially  time  series)  regardless  of  what  the  dataset  might  represent.    An  intelligent  firm  will  not  care  whether  you  arrive  at  their  doorstep  with  zero  finance  knowledge;  they  will  want  to  teach  you  everything  from  scratch  anyway.  Nonetheless,  some  domain  knowledge  could  be  helpful,  but  you're  not  going  to  get  "more"  of  it  from  reading  any  mass  market  news  source,  whether  you  have  to  pay  for  it  or  not.    That's  because    Some  non-mass-market  news  sources  in  the  industry  are    These  are  subscription-only  and  actually  discuss  real  information  that  real  professional  investors  care  about.    They  are  loaded  with  industry  jargon,  they're  extremely  opinionated,  and  (in  my  opinion)  they're  useless.    I  can't  imagine  trying  to  learn  about  the  industry  from  them,  but  if  you  want  to  spend  money  for  news  in  order  to  be  exposed  to  the  innards  of  the  industry,  then  either  of  these  is  far  better  than  the  Financial  Times.    Despite  requiring  a  subscription,  the  Financial  Times  still  does  not  cover  the  technical  details  of  professional  trading.  Instead  of  trying  to  learn  from  news,  then,  I  would  suggest  some  old  favorites:  and,  above  all  else,  Read  everything  in  the  navigation  box  on  the  right  side  under  Financial  Markets  and  Financial  Instruments.
554891	I  recommend  using  Morning  Brew.  They  email  you  a  free  daily  newsletter  with  the  top  financial  news  stories  and  earnings  events.  I  have  subscribed  to  the  Wall  Street  Journal  and  Financial  Times  before.  Morning  Brew  basically  covers  all  of  the  headlines  you  would  see  on  those  sites.
479384	Institutional  ownership  has  nearly  lost  all  meaning.  It  used  to  mean  mutual  funds,  investment  banks,  etc.  Now,  it  means  pension  funds,  who  hold  the  rest  of  the  equity  assets  directly,  and  insiders.  Since  the  vast  majority  of  investors  in  equity  do  not  hold  it  directly,  "institutions"  are  approaching  100%  ownership  on  all  major  equities.  Other  sites  still  segment  the  data.
384583	No.  The  information  you  are  describing  is  technical  data  about  a  stock's  market  price  and  trading  volume,  only.  There  is  nothing  implied  in  that  data  about  a  company's  financial  fundamentals  (earnings/profitability,  outstanding  shares,  market  capitalization,  dividends,  balance  sheet  assets  and  liabilities,  etc.)  All  you  can  infer  is  positive  or  negative  momentum  in  the  trading  of  the  stock.  If  you  want  to  understand  if  a  company  is  performing  well,  then  you  need  fundamental  data  about  the  company  such  as  you  would  get  from  a  company's  annual  and  quarterly  reports.
538060	As  the  commenters  have  already  indicated,  money  market  mutual  funds  are  not  guaranteed  to  maintain  principal  during  all  market  conditions,  and  investments  in  mutual  funds  are  not  insured  against  loss  due  to  market  changes.  That  said,  you  can  run  a  price  search  on  Vanguard's  website  and  see  these  results:  So,  despite  all  the  economic  problems  since  1975,  VMMXX  has  never  traded  at  a  price  other  than  $1.00.
195967	Wikipedia  has  a  solid  article  on  Money  Market  Funds  which  includes  a  section  on  "Breaking  the  Buck"  when  the  money  market  fund  fails  to  return  its  full  dollar.    Money  market  funds  smoothing  out  the  daily  (generally  small)  fluctuations  of  investing  in  short-term  treasuries  directly  but  have  similar  risk  over  longer  periods.    Some  funds  can  and  have  lost  money  in  market  crashes,  though  even  the  worst  performers  still  returned  95+  cents  on  the  dollar.  While  few  investments  are  guaranteed  and  likely  none  in  your  retirement  account,    money-market  funds  are  likely  the  choice  you  have  with  the  least  fluctuation  and  similar  minimal  risk  to  short  term  treasuries.  However,  a  second  important  risk  to  consider  is  inflation.    Money  market  funds  generally  have  returns  similar  or  less  than  the  inflation  rate.    While  money  markets  funds  help  you  avoid  the  fluctuations  of  the  stock  market  the  value  of  your  retirement  account  falls  behind  the  cost  of  goods  over  time.    Unless  the  investor  is  fairly  old  most  financial  professionals  would  recommend  only  a  small  portion  of  a  retirement  account  be  in  money  market  instruments.    Vanguard  also  has  a  set  of  target  retirement  investment  funds  that  are  close  to  what  many  professionals  would  recommend.    Consulting  a  financial  professional  to  discuss  your  particular  needs  is  a  good  option  as  well.
99727	It  really  depends  on  the  exact  wording  of  that  zero  rate  offer.    Some  specifically  state  they  are  to  be  used  for  paying  other  debt.  Others  will  have  wording  such  as  "pay  other  debt  or  write  yourself  a  check  to  pay  for  that  next  vacation,  or  new  furniture."    Sorry,  it's  back  on  you  to  check  this  out  in  advance.
60261	You  do  not  say  what  country  you  are  in.  This  is  an  answer  for  readers  in  the  UK.  Most  normal  balance  transfer  deals  are  only  for  paying  off  other  credit  cards.  However  there  are  "money  transfer"  deals  that  will  pay  the  money  direct  to  your  bank  account.  The  deals  aren't  as  good  as  balance  transfer  deals  but  they  are  often  a  competitive  option  compared  to  other  types  of  borrowing.    Another  option  depending  on  how  much  you  need  to  borrow  and  your  regular  spending  habits  is  to  get  a  card  with  a  "0%  for  purchases"  deal  and  use  that  card  for  your  regular  shopping,  then  put  the  money  you  would  have  spent  on  your  regular  shopping  towards  the  car.
416409	I  still  can't  understand  why  there  is  a  price  discrepancancy.    There  isn't.  It's  the  same  stock  and  price  differences  between  such  major  exchanges  will  always  be  minimal.  I  think  you  simply  haven't  paid  attention  to  the  date  range.  It  seems  Google  finance  only  has  data  for  FRA:BMW  reaching  back  to  2011,  so  if  you  try  to  look  at  the  development  of  your  investment  since  2009,  you're  not  getting  comparable  data.
485757	I  stumbled  on  the  same  discrepancy,  and  was  puzzled  by  a  significant  difference  between  the  two  prices  on  ETR  and  FRA.  For  example,  today  is  Sunday,  and  google  shows  the  following  closing  prices  for  DAI.  FRA:DAI:  ETR:DAI:  So  it  looks  like  there  are  indeed  two  different  exchanges  trading  at  different  prices.    Now,  the  important  value  here,  is  the  last  column  (Volume).  According  to  Wikipedia,  the  trading  on  Frankfort  Stock  Exchange  is  done  today  exclusively  via  Xetra  platform,  thus  the  volume  on  ETR:DAI  is  much  more  important  than  on  FRA:DAI.    Obviously,  they  Wikipedia  is  not  100%  accurate,  i.e.  not  all  trading  is  done  electronically  via  Xetra.  According  to  their  web-page,  Frankfort  exchange  has  a  Specialist  Trading  on  Frankfurt  Floor  service  which  has  slightly  different  trading  hours.    I  suspect  what  Google  and  Yahoo  show  as  Frankfort  exchange  is  this  manual  trading  via  a  Specialist  (opposed  to  Xetra  electronic  trading).  To  answer  your  question,  the  stock  you're  having  is  exactly  the  same,  meaning  if  you  bought  an  ETR:BMW  you  can  still  sell  it  on  FRA  (by  calling  a  FRA  Trading  Floor  Specialist  which  will  probably  cost  you  a  fee).  On  the  other  hand,  for  the  portfolio  valuation  and  performance  assessments  you  should  only  use  ETR:BMW  prices,  because  it  is  way  more  liquid,  and  thus  better  reflect  the  current  market  valuation.
46774	This  looks  more  like  an  aggregation  problem.  The  Dividends  and  Capital  Gains  are  on  quite  a  few  occassions  not  on  same  day  and  hence  the  way  Yahoo  is  aggregating  could  be  an  issue.  There  is  a  seperate  page  with  Dividends  and  capital  gains  are  shown  seperately,  however  as  these  funds  have  not  given  payouts  every  year,  it  seems  there  is  some  bug  in  aggregating  this  info  at  yahoo's  end.

115087	I  think  it  depends  where  you  live  in  the  world,  but  I  guess  the  most  common  would  be:  Major  Equity  Indices  I  would  say  major  currency  exchange  rate:  And  have  a  look  at  the  Libors  for  USD  and  EUR.  I  guess  the  intent  of  the  question  is  more  to  see  how  implicated  you  are  in  the  daily  market  analysis,  not  really  to  see  if  you  managed  to  learn  everything  by  heart  in  the  morning.
542098	In  addition  to  the  information  in  the  other  answer,  I  would  suggest  looking  at  an  economic  calendar.  These  provide  the  dates  and  values  of  many  economic  announcements,  e.g.  existing  home  sales,  durable  orders,  consumer  confidence,  etc.  Yahoo,  Bloomberg,  and  the  Wall  Street  Journal  all  provide  such  calendars.  Yahoo  provides  links  to  the  raw  data  where  available;  Bloomberg  and  the  WSJ  provide  links  to  their  article  where  appropriate.  You  could  also  look  at  a  global  economic  calendar;  both  xe.com  and  livecharts.co.uk  provide  these.  If  you're  only  interested  in  the  US,  the  Yahoo,  Bloomberg,  and  WSJ  calendars  may  provide  a  higher  signal-to-noise  ratio,  but  foreign  announcements  also  affect  US  markets,  so  it's  important  to  get  as  much  perspective  as  possible.  I  like  the  global  economic  calendars  I  linked  to  above  because  they  rate  announcements  on  "priority",  which  is  a  quick  way  to  learn  which  announcements  have  the  greatest  effect.  Economic  calendars  are  especially  important  in  the  context  of  an  interview  because  you  may  be  asked  a  follow-up  question.  For  example,  the  US  markets  jumped  in  early  trading  today  (5/28/2013)  because  the  consumer  confidence  numbers  exceeded  forecasts  (from  the  WSJ  calendar,  76.2  vs  2.3).    As  SRKX  stated,  it's  important  to  know  more  than  the  numbers;  being  able  to  analyze  the  numbers  in  the  context  of  the  wider  market  and  being  aware  of  the  fundamentals  driving  them  is  what's  most  important.  An  economic  calendar  is  a  good  way  to  see  this  information  quickly  and  succinctly.    (I'm  paraphrasing  part  of  my  answer  to  another  question,  so  you  may  or  may  not  find  some  of  that  information  helpful  as  well;  I'm  certainly  not  suggesting  you  look  at  the  website  of  every  central  bank  in  the  morning.  That's  what  an  economic  calendar  is  for!)
360439	Google  Finance  and  Yahoo!  Finance  would  be  a  couple  of  sites  you  could  use  to  look  at  rather  broad  market  information.    This  would  include  the  major  US  stock  markets  like  the  Dow,  Nasdaq,  S  &  P  500  though  also  bond  yields,  gold  and  oil  can  also  be  useful  as  depending  on  which  area  one  works  the  specifics  of  what  are  important  could  vary.    If  you  were  working  at  a  well-known  bond  firm,  I'd  suspect  that  various  bond  benchmarks  are  likely  to  be  known  and  watched  rather  than  stock  indices.  Something  else  to  consider  here  is  what  constitutes  a  "finance  practitioner"  as  I'd  imagine  several  accountants  and  actuaries  may  not  watch  the  market  yet  there  could  be  several  software  developers  working  at  hedge  funds  that  do  so  that  it  isn't  just  a  case  of  what  kind  of  work  but  also  what  does  the  company  do.
421940	You  can  be  a  co-borrower  on  the  property  that  your  father  owns.  Some  Banks  require  that  you  also  be  part  owner  of  the  property,  some  banks  do  not  require  this.  You  can  take  a  home  loan  for  a  new  property,  normally  Banks  will  ask  you  of  all  your  current  loans  [auto/other  home/personal/  etc]  to  determine  the  amount  they  will  be  ready  to  lend.  Edit:  The  first  loan  I  believe  your  father  already  has  a  property  in  his  name  ...  your  father  can  apply  for  Loan  against  property  ...  if  he  does  not  have  sufficient  income,  then  you  can  guarantee  the  loan  [ie  co-sign  on  the  loan,  some  banks  allow  this  ...  however  there  is  no  tax  benefit  on  this  loan]    .      The  second  is  the  Home  Loan  for  the  balance  amount  that  you  would  get  it  …  Both  the  loans  can  be  taken  from  the  same  Bank,  there  would  be  a  overall  cap  as  to  the  amount  of  loan  a  Bank  would  give  depending  on  your  income,  further  the  finance  for  this  house  will  only  be  to  the  extent  of  80%  of  the  value.
40980	Yes,  there  is  such  possibility.  Also,  there's  a  possibility  people  made  your  computer,  your  operation  system,  your  browser,  etc.  put  there  some  code  there  that  would  intercept  your  communications  and  steal  your  money.  So  could  bank  clerks  (and  unlike  all  other  examples,  this  really  happened  in  real  world,  numerous  times,  though  usually  at  smaller  banks),  ATM  makers,  etc.    In  the  modern  world,  you  rely  on  things  made  by  thousands  of  people,  this  is  a  part  of  modern  world's  conveniences.  You  don't  have  to  use  it  -  you  can  store  all  your  money  in  a  big  jar  in  your  basement  and  nobody  but  occasional  thief  breaking  in  could  take  it.    However,  fraudulent  unauthorized  transactions  in  most  banks  can  be  rolled  back,  and  any  transaction  is  reported  to  you.  So  fraud  from  mint.com  people  would  be  quite  low  on  my  list  of  risks.  Much  bigger  risk  is  that  somebody  could  break  into  mint.com  servers  and  steal  information  about  your  accounts  from  there  or  install  some  malicious  code.  I  believe  they  have  good  protections,  but  no  security  system  is  perfect.  You  need  to  evaluate  how  the  convenience  of  using  mint.com  compares  to  your  personal  feeling  about  this  risk.  If  you  feel  you  couldn't  sleep  at  night  knowing  somewhere  out  there  there  is  information  about  your  money  -  don't  use  it.  I  don't  worry  about  it  too  much  as  I  know  the  chance  of  it  happening  is  low  and  the  chance  of  getting  the  money  back  if  it  happens  is  high,  but  if  you  feel  differently  -  don't  do  it.
173649	So  could  someone  working  at  your  bank  directly.    Of  at  your  HR  department  at  work.    Most  of  the  wait  staff  at  the  restaurant  I  ate  at  technically  had  access  to  my  credit  card  and  could  steal  money.    While  you  are  at  work,  someone  could  break  into  your  house  and  steal  your  stuff  too.  The  point  is,  Mint  and  everything  else  is  a  matter  of  the  evaluating  the  risk.    Since  you  already  understand  the  vulnerability  (they  have  your  accounts)  and  you  know  the  risk  (they  could  steal  your  money)  what  are  the  chances  it  happens?  1.)    Mint  will  make  lots  more  money  if  it  doesn't  happen,  so  it  benefits  Intuit  to  pay  their  employees  well  and  put  in  safeguards  to  prevent  theft.    Mint.com  is  on  your  side  even  if  a  specific  employee  isn't.  2.)    You  have  statements  and  such,  so  you  can  independently  evaluate  mint.    I  do  not  just  trust  mint  with  my  stuff,  I  check  info  in  Quicken  and  at  the  bank  sites  themselves.    I  don't  do  them  all  equally,  but  I  will  catch  problems.  3.)    Laws  mean  that  if  theft  happens,  you  will  have  the  opportunity  to  be  made  whole.  If  you  are  worried  about  theft,  don't  trust  other  people  or  generally  get  a  bad  feeling,  don't  do  it.    If  you  check  your  accounts  online  with  the  same  computer  you  log  into  Facebook  with,  them  I  would  suggest  it  doesn't  bother  you.    You  might  have  legal  or  business  reasons  to  be  more  adverse  to  risk  then  me.  However,  just  because  somebody  could  steal  your  money,  I  personally  don't  consider  it  an  acceptable  risk  compared  to  the  reward.  I  will  also  be  one  of  the  first  people  to  be  robbed,  I  am  not  unrealistic.
107801	A  number  of  sites  provide  delayed  option  chains  online.  Yahoo  Finance  is  one  example:    I  linked  to  Apple's  chain,  but  to  get  one  yourself,  put  the  ticker  you  want  in  the  search  box,  then  click  the  "options"  link  in  the  sidebar  that  I  called  out  in  the  image.
25624	In  addition,  since  you  asked  for  Montreal,  you  can  get  the  quotes  directly.  http://www.m-x.ca/nego_cotes_en.php
118289	USB  is  the  ticker  for  US  Bancorp.  The  numbers  to  me  look  like  their  prediction  of  the  return  for  the  day,  I  could  be  wrong  but  I  think  that's  what  it  is.
16961	The  Federal  Reserve  Bank  publishes  exchange  rate  data  in  their  H.10  release.  It  is  daily,  not  minute  by  minute.  The  Fed  says  this  about  their  data:  About  the  Release  The  H.10  weekly  release  contains  daily  rates  of      exchange  of  major  currencies  against  the  U.S.  dollar.  The  data  are      noon  buying  rates  in  New  York  for  cable  transfers  payable  in  the      listed  currencies.  The  rates  have  been  certified  by  the  Federal      Reserve  Bank  of  New  York  for  customs  purposes  as  required  by  section      522  of  the  amended  Tariff  Act  of  1930.  The  historical  EURUSD  rates  for  the  value  of  1  EURO  in  US$  are  at:  http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/hist/dat00_eu.htm  If  you  need  to  know  USDEUR  the  value  of  1  US$  in  EUROS  use  division  1.0/EURUSD.
409190	Below  I  will  try  to  explain  two  most  common  Binomial  Option  Pricing  Models  (BOPM)  used.  First  of  all,  BOPM  splits  time  to  expiry  into  N  equal  sub-periods  and  assumes  that  in  each  period  the  underlying  security  price  may  rise  or  fall  by  a  known  proportion,  so  the  value  of  an  option  in  any  sub-period  is  a  function  of  its  possible  values  in  the  following  sub  period.  Therefore  the  current  value  of  an  option  is  found  by  working  backwards  from  expiry  date  through  sub-periods  to  current  time.  There  is  not  enough  information  in  the  question  from  your  textbook  so  we  may  assume  that  what  you  are  asked  to  do  is  to  find  a  value  of  a  call  option  using  just  a  Single  Period  BOPM.  Here  are  two  ways  of  doing  this:  First  of  all  let's  summarize  your  information:  Current  Share  Price  (Vs)  =  $70  Strike  or  exercise  price  (X)  =  $60  Risk-free  rate  (r)  =  5.5%  or  0.055  Time  to  maturity  (t)  =  12  months  Downward  movement  in  share  price  for  the  period  (d)  =  $65  /  $70  =  0.928571429  Upward  movement  in  share  price  for  the  period  (u)  =  1/d  =  1/0.928571429  =  1.076923077  "u"  can  be  translated  to  $  multiplying  by  Vs  =>  1.076923077  *  $70  =  $75.38  which  is  the  maximum  probable  share  price  in  12  months  time.  If  you  need  more  clarification  here  -  the  minimum  and  maximum  future  share  prices  are  calculated  from  stocks  past  volatility  which  is  a  measure  of  risk.  But  because  your  textbook  question  does  not  seem  to  be  asking  this  -  you  probably  don't  have  to  bother  too  much  about  it  yet.  Intrinsic  Value:  Just  in  case  someone  reading  this  is  unclear  -  the  Value  of  an  option  on  maturity  is  the  difference  between  the  exercise  (strike)  price  and  the  value  of  a  share  at  the  time  of  the  option  maturity.  This  is  also  called  an  intrinsic  value.    Note  that  American  Option  can  be  exercised  prior  to  it's  maturity  in  this  case  the  intrinsic  value  it  simply  the  diference  between  strike  price  and  the  underlying  share  price  at  the  time  of  an  exercise.  But  the  Value  of  an  option  at  period  0  (also  called  option  price)  is  a  price  you  would  normally  pay  in  order  to  buy  it.  So,  say,  with  a  strike  of  $60  and  Share  Price  of  $70  the  intrinsic  value  is  $10,  whereas  if  Share  Price  was  $50  the  intrinsic  value  would  be  $0.  The  option  price  or  the  value  of  a  call  option  in  both  cases  would  be  fixed.    So  we  also  need  to  find  intrinsic  option  values  when  price  falls  to  the  lowest  probable  and  rises  to  the  maximum  probable  (Vcd  and  Vcu  respectively)  (Vcd)  =  $65-$60  =  $5  (remember  if  Strike  was  $70  then  Vcd  would  be  $0  because  nobody  would  exercise  an  option  that  is  out  of  the  money)  (Vcu)  =  $75.38-$60  =  $15.38  1.  Setting  up  a  hedge  ratio:    h  =  Vs*(u-d)/(Vcu-Vcd)  h  =  70*(1.076923077-0.928571429)/(15.38-5)  =  1  That  means  we  have  to  write  (sell)  1  option  for  each  share  purchased  in  order  to  hedge  the  risks.  You  can  make  a  simple  calculation  to  check  this,  but  I'm  not  going  to  go  into  too  much  detail  here  as  the  equestion  is  not  about  hedging.  Because  this  position  is  risk-free  in  equilibrium  it  should  pay  a  risk-free  rate  (5.5%).  Then,  the  formula  to  price  an  option  (Vc)  using  the  hedging  approach  is:  (Vs-hVc)(e^(rt))=(Vsu-hVcu)  Where  (Vc)  is  the  value  of  the  call  option,  (h)  is  the  hedge  ratio,  (Vs)  -  Current  Share  Price,  (Vsu)  -  highest  probable  share  price,  (r)  -  risk-free  rate,  (t)  -  time  in  years,  (Vcu)  -  value  of  a  call  option  on  maturity  at  the  highest  probable  share  price.  Therefore  solving  for  (Vc):  (70-1*Vc)(e^(0.055*(12/12)))  =  (75.38-1*15.38)  =>  (70-Vc)*1.056540615  =  60  =>  70-Vc  =  60/1.056540615  =>  Vc  =  70  -  (60/1.056540615)    Which  is  similar  to  the  formula  given  in  your  textbook,  so  I  must  assume  that  using  1+r  would  be  simply  a  very  close  approximation  of  the  formula  above.  Then  it  is  easy  to  find  that  Vc  =  13.2108911402  ~  $13.21  2.  Risk-neutral  valuation:  Another  way  to  calculate  (Vc)  is  using  a  risk-neutral  approach.  We  first  introduce  a  variable  (p)  which  is  a  risk-neutral  probability  of  an  increase  in  share  price.  p  =  (e^(r*t)-d)/(u-d)  so  in  your  case:  p  =  (1.056540615-0.928571429)/(1.076923077-0.928571429)  =  0.862607107  Therefore  using  (p)  the  (Vc)  would  be  equal:  Vc  =  [pVcu+(1-p)Vcd]/(e^(rt))  =>  Vc  =  [(0.862607107*15.38)+(0.137392893*5)]/1.056540615  =>  Vc  =  13.2071229185  ~  $13.21  As  you  can  see  it  is  very  close  to  the  hedging  approach.  I  hope  this  answers  your  questions.  Also  bear  in  mind  that  there  is  much  more  to  the  option  pricing  than  this.  The  most  important  topics  to  cover  are:  Multi-period  BOPM  Accounting  for  Dividends  Black-Scholes-Merton  Option  Pricing  Model
585139	I  think  you're  looking  for  the  public  float:  Public  float  or  the  unqualified  term  may  also  refer  to  the  number  of      outstanding  shares  in  the  hands  of  public  investors  as  opposed  to      company  officers,  directors,  or  controlling-interest  investors.      Assuming  the  insider  held  shares  are  not  traded,  these  shares  are  the      publicly  traded  ones.  The  float  is  calculated  by  subtracting      restricted  shares  from  outstanding  shares.  As  mentioned,  Treasury  stock  is  probably  the  most  narrow  definition  of  restricted  stock  (not  publicly  traded),  but  shares  held  by  corporate  officers  or  majority  investors  are  often  included  in  the  definition  as  well.  In  any  case,  the  balance  sheet  is  indeed  a  good  place  to  start.
563151	The  best  place  to  start  looking  is  the  companies  "Balance  Sheet"  (B/S).    This  would  show  you  the  total  shares  "outstanding."  The  quarterly  B/S's  arent  audited  but  a  good  starting  point.    To  use  in  any  quant  method,  You  also  need  to  look  a  growth  the  outstanding  shares  number.  Company  can  issue  shares  to  any  employee  without  making  a  filing.    Also,  YOU  will  NEVER  know  exactly  the  total  number  because  of  stock  options  that  are  issued  to  employees  that  are  out  of  the  money  arent  account  for.  Some  companies  account  for  these,  some  dont.    You  should  also  explore  the  concepts  of  "fully  dilute"  shares  and  "basis"  shares.  These  concepts  will  throw-off  your  calc  if  the  company  has  convertible  bonds.
424079	The  short  answer  is  the  annualised  volatility  over  twenty  years  should  be  pretty  much  the  same  as  the  annualised  volatility  over  five  years.  For  independent,  identically  distributed  returns  the  volatility  scales  proportionally.  So  for  any  number  of  monthly  returns  T,  setting  the  annualization  factor  m  =  12  annualises  the  volatility.    It  should  be  the  same  for  all  time  scales.    However,  note  the  discussion  here:  https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/7496/7178  Scaling  volatility  [like  this]  only  is  mathematically  correct  when  the      underlying  price  model  is  driven  by  Geometric  Brownian  motion  which      implies  that  prices  are  log  normally  distributed  and  returns  are      normally  distributed.  Particularly  the  comment:  "its  a  well  known  fact  that  volatility  is  overestimated  when  scaled  over  long  periods  of  time  without  a  change  of  model  to  estimate  such  "long-term"  volatility."  Now,  a  demonstration.    I  have  modelled  12,000  monthly  returns  with  mean  =  3%  and  standard  deviation  =  2,  so  the  annualised  volatility  should  be  Sqrt(12)  *  2  =  6.9282.      Calculating  annualised  volatility  for  return  sequences  of  various  lengths  (3,  6,  12,  60  months  etc.)  reveals  an  inaccuracy  for  shorter  sequences.    The  five-year  sequence  average  got  closest  to  the  theoretically  expected  figure  (6.9282),  and,  as  the  commenter  noted  "volatility  is  [slightly]  overestimated  when  scaled  over  long  periods  of  time".  Annualised  volatility  for  varying  return  sequence  lengths    Edit  re.  comment  Reinvesting  returns  does  not  affect  the  volatility  much.    For  instance,  comparing  some  data  I  have  handy,  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  Capital  Returns  (CR)  versus  Net  Returns  (NR).    The  return  differences  are  somewhat  smoothed,  0.1%  each  month,  0.25%  every  third  month.    More  erratic  dividend  reinvestment  would  increase  the  volatility.
547301	Like  you  said,  it's  important  to  keep  your  personal  assets  and  company  assets  completely  separate  to  maintain  the  liability  protection  of  the  LLC.  I'd  recommend  getting  the  business  bank  account  right  from  the  beginning.  My  wife  formed  an  LLC  last  year  (also  as  a  pass-through  sole  proprietorship  for  tax  purposes),  and  we  were  able  to  get  a  small  business  checking  account  from  Savings  Institute  and  Trust  that  has  no  fees  (at  least  for  the  relatively  low  quantity  of  transactions  we'll  be  doing).  We  wrote  it  a  personal  check  for  startup  capital,  and  since  then,  the  LLC  has  paid  all  of  its  own  bills  out  of  its  checking  account  (with  associated  debit  card).  Getting  the  account  opened  took  less  than  an  hour  of  sitting  at  the  bank.  Without  knowing  exactly  where  you  are  in  Kentucky,  I  note  that  Googling  "kentucky  small  business  checking"  and  visiting  a  few  banks'  web  sites  provided  several  promising  options  for  no-fee  business  checking.
487776	Between  half  a  year  and  a  year  should  be  enough  to  improve  your  interest  rates  drastically  on  car  loan  refinance.  Make  sure  that  your  new  credit  card  has  already  been  reported  to  the  agencies,  and  that  the  credit/debt  ratio  is  lower  than  30%  on  your  revolving  (credit  card)  accounts.  That  also  means  that  you  shouldn't  carry  too  much  balance,  even  if  the  APR  is  0%.
472014	Option  1:  You  can  write  to    uanepf@epfindia.gov.in  giving  the  details  of  both  the  UAN's.  This  will  be  able  to  merge  both  these  under  the  current  EPF.  Option  2:  You  can  request  a  transfer  of  EPF  from  old  EPF  [under  different  UAN]  to  the  current  EPF.  This  can  be  done  by  submitting  the  required  form.  Your  company  should  be  able  to  assist  you  with  the  paperwork.  Alternatively  if  you  are  registered  online  with  EPFO  India,  you  can  submit  the  request  online.  Once  submitted,  the  system  will  identify  that  a  duplicate  UAN  has  been  issued  and  automatically  merge  the  accounts.
29828	I  can  think  of  three  things  you  might  do:  Talk  to  a  fee-only  adviser.  As  the  comments  suggest,  this  would  only  be  one  or  two  sessions  to  lay  out  what  all  you  have,  establish  what  you  want  it  to  do,  and  write  a  plan  that  you  are  comfortable  carrying  out  yourself.  What  do  your  401k  and  Roth  IRA  look  like?  If  you  mean  for  this  money  to  be  long-term,  then  your  retirement  portfolio  might  be  a  good  place  to  start.  I  don't  currently  own  them,  but  one  of  my  personally  hobby  horses  is  I-Series  Savings  Bonds,  commonly  called  I  Bonds.  Even  in  the  current  low  interest  rate  environment,  they  are  a  good  deal  relative  to  everything  else  out  there.  I  summarized  this  more  fully  in  my  answer  to  another  question.  You  can  invest  up  to  $10,000  per  SSN  per  year,  and  the  interest  rate  is  the  sum  of  a  fixed  rate  plus  a  floating  rate  based  on  CPI.  Currently  the  fixed  rate  is  0%,  but  the  floating  rate  is  better  than  what  you  can  get  from  most  other  cash-like  instruments.
4153	Congratulations  on  being  in  such  good  financial  state.    You  have  a  few  investment  choices.  If  you  want  very  low  risk,  you  are  talking  bonds  or  CDs.  With  the  prime  rate  so  low,  nobody  is  paying  anything  useful  for  very  low  risk  investments.    However,  my  opinion  is  that  given  your  finances,  you  should  consider  taking  on  a  little  more  risk.  A  good  step  is  a  index  fund,  which  is  designed  to  mirror  the  performance  of  a  stock  index  such  as  the  S&P  500.  That  may  be  volatile  in  the  short-term,  but  is  likely  to  be  a  good  investment  in  the  longer  term.  I  am  not  a  fan  of  non-index  mutual  funds;  in  general  the  management  charge  makes  them  a  less  attractive  investment.    The  next  step  up  is  investing  in  individual  stocks,  which  can  provide  very  big  gains  or  very  big  losses.    The  Motley  fool  site  (www.fool.com)  has  a  lot  of  information  about  investing  overall.
467830	Look  at  a  mixture  of  low-fee  index  funds,  low-fee  bond  funds,  and  CDs.  The  exact  allocation  has  to  be  tailored  to  your  appetite  for  risk.  If  you  only  want  to  park  the  money  with  essentially  no  risk  of  loss  then  you  need  FDIC  insured  products  like  CDs  or  a  money  market  account  (as  opposed  to  a  money  market  fund  which  is  not  FDIC  insured).  However  as  others  have  said,  interest  rates  are  awful  now.    Since  you  are  in  your  early  30's,  and  expect  to  keep  this  investment  for  10+  years,  you  can  probably  tolerate  a  bit  of  risk.  Also  considering  speaking  to  a  tax  professional  to  determine  the  specific  tax  benefits/drawbacks  of  one  investment  strategy  (funds  and  CDs)  versus  another  (e.g.  real  estate).
212540	So,  you  have  $100k  to  invest,  want  a  low-maintenance  investment,  and  personal  finance  bores  you  to  death.  Oooohhh,  investment  companies  are  gonna  love  you.    You'll  hand  them  a  wad  of  cash,  and  more  or  less  say  "do  what  you  want."    You're  making  someone's  day.    (Just  probably  not  yours.)  Mutual  fund  companies  make  money  off  of  you  regardless  of  whether  you  make  money  or  not.    They  don't  care  one  bit  how  carefully  you  look  at  your  investments.    As  long  as  the  money  is  in  their  hands,  they  get  their  fee.  If  I  had  that  much  cash,  I'd  be  looking  around  for  a  couple  of  distressed  homes  in  good  neighborhoods  to  buy  as  rentals.    I  could  put  down  payments  on  two  of  them,  lock  in  fixed  30-year  mortgages  at  4%  (do  you  realize  how  stupid  low  that  is?)  and  plop  tenants  in  there.    Lots  of  tax  write-offs,  cash  flow,  the  works.    It's  a  10%  return  if  you  learn  about  it  and  do  it  correctly.  Or,  there  have  been  a  number  of  really  great  websites  that  were  sold  on  Flippa.com  that  ran  into  five  figures.    You  could  probably  pay  those  back  in  a  year.    But  that  requires  some  knowledge,  too.  Anything  worthwhile  requires  learning,  maintenance  and  effort.  You'll  have  to  research  stocks,  mutual  funds,  bonds,  anything,  if  you  want  a  better  than  average  chance  of  getting  worthwhile  returns  (that  is,  something  that  beats  inflation,  which  savings  accounts  and  CDs  are  unlikely  to  do).    There  is  no  magic  bullet.    If  someone  does  manage  to  find  a  magic  bullet,  what  happens?    Everyone  piles  on,  drives  the  price  up,  and  the  return  goes  down.  Your  thing  might  not  be  real  estate,  but  what  is  your  thing?    What  excites  you  (i.e.,  doesn't  bore  you  to  death)?  There  are  lots  of  investments  out  there,  but  you'll  get  out  of  it  what  you  put  into  it.
222921	You  can  buy  dividend  stocks,  just  buy  and  hold.  you  will  get  cash  or  extra  stock  every  quarter.  You  can  also  sell  covered  calls  on  your  dividend  stocks,  this  will  give  you  even  more  cash.  you  can  also...  actually  this  rabbit  hole  goes  very  deep.  just  stick  with  my  first  sentence.
428900	There  are  several  variables  to  consider.  Taxes,  fees,  returns.  Taxes  come  in  two  stages.  While  adding  money  to  the  account  you  can  save  on  state  taxes,  if  the  account  is  linked  to  your  state.  If  you  use  an  out  of  state  529  plan  there  is  no  tax  savings.  Keep  in  mind  that  other  people  (such  as  grandparents)  can  set  aside  money  in  the  529  plan.  $1500  a  year  with  6%  state  taxes,  saves  you  $90  in  state  taxes  a  year.  The  second  place  it  saves  you  taxes  is  that  the  earnings,  if  they  are  used  for  educational  purposes  are  tax  free.  You  don't  pay  taxes  on  the  gains  during  the  10+  years  the  account  exists.  If  those  expenses  meet  the  IRS  guidelines  they  will  never  be  taxed.    It  does  get  tricky  because  you  can't  double  dip  on  expenses.  A  dollar  from  the  529  plan  can't  be  used  to  pay  for  an  expenses  that  will  be  claimed  as  part  of  the  education  tax  credit.  How  those  rules  will  change  in  the  next  18  years  is  unknown.  Fees:  They  are  harder  to  guess  what  will  happen  over  the  decades.  As  a  whole  401(k)  programs  have  had  to  become  more  transparent  regarding  their  fees.  I  hope  the  same  will  be  true  for  the  state  run  529  programs.    Returns:  One  option  in  many  (all?)  plans  is  an  automatic  change  in  risk  as  the  child  gets  closer  to  college.  A  newborn  will  be  all  stock,  a  high  school  senior  will  be  all  bonds.  Many  (all?)  also  allow  you  to  opt  out  of  the  automatic  risk  shift,  though  they  will  limit  the  number  of  times  you  can  switch  the  option.  Time  horizon  Making  a  decision  that  will  impact  numbers  18  years  from  now  is  hard  to  gauge.  Laws  and  rules  may  change.  The  existence  of  tax  breaks  and  their  rules  are  hard  to  predict.  But  one  area  you  can  consider  is  that  if  you  move  states  you  can  roll  over  the  money  into  a  new  account,  or  create  a  second  account  in  the  new  state.  to  take  advantage  of  the  tax  breaks  there.    There  are  also  rules  regarding  transferring  of  funds  to  another  person,  the  impact  of  scholarships,  and  attending  schools  like  the  service  academies.  The  tax  breaks  at  deposit  are  important  but  the  returns  can  be  significant.  And  the  ability  shelter  them  in  the  529  is  very  important.
316866	A  straddle  is  an  options  strategy  in  which  one  "buys"  or  "sells"  options  of  the  same  maturity  (expiry  date)  that  allow  the  "buyer"  or  "seller"  to  profit  based  on  how  much  the  price  of  the  underlying  security  moves,  regardless  of  the  direction  of  price  movement.  IE:  A  long  straddle  would  be:  You  buy  a  call  and  a  put  at  the  same  strike  price  and  the  same  expiration  date.  Your  profit  would  be  if  the  underlying  asset(the  stock)  moves  far  enough  down  or  up(higher  then  the  premiums  you  paid  for  the  put  +  call  options)  (In  case,  one  waits  till  expiry)  Profit  =  Expiry  Level  -  Strike  Price  -  (Premium  Paid  for  Bought  Options)  Straddle
32127	Came  across  this  very  nice  video  which  explains  the  "Long  Straddle".  Thought  will  share  the  link  here:  http://www.khanacademy.org/finance-economics/core-finance/v/long-straddle
205098	You  are  still  paying  a  heavy  price  for  the  'instant  gratification'  of  driving  (renting)  a  brand-new  car  that  you  will  not  own  at  the  end  of  the  terms.  It  is  not  a  good  idea  in  your  case,  since  this  luxury  expense  sounds  like  a  large  amount  of  money  for  you.    Edited  to  better  answer  question  The  most  cost  effective  solution:  Purchase  a  $2000  car  now.  Place  the  $300/mo  payment  aside  for  3  years.  Then,  go  buy  a  similar  car  that  is  3  years  old.  You  will  have  almost  $10k  in  cash  and  probably  will  need  minimal,  if  any,  financing.  Same  as  this  answer  from  Pete:  https://money.stackexchange.com/a/63079/40014  Does  this  plan  seem  like  a  reasonable  way  to  proceed,  or  a  big  mistake?  "Reasonable"  is  what  you  must  decide.  As  the  first  paragraph  states,  you  are  paying  a  large  expense  to  operate  the  vehicle.  Whether  you  lease  or  buy,  you  are  still  paying  this  expense,  especially  from  the  depreciation  on  a  new  vehicle.  It  does  not  seem  reasonable  to  pay  for  this  luxury  if  the  cost  is  significant  to  you.  That  said,  it  will  probably  not  be  a  'big  mistake'  that  will  destroy  your  finances,  just  not  the  best  way  to  set  yourself  up  for  long-term  success.
100124	What  does  not  seem  reasonable  about  your  plan  is  the  payment  and  buyout.    While  $200/month  payments  are  possible  (but  hard  to  find),  buyouts  are  more  typically  in  the  five  figure  range.  Given  that  your  savings  and  desired  payment  for  a  car  is  low  (the  average  car  payment  today  is  about  450/month),  can  you  really  afford  the  massive  depreciation  of  a  late  model  vehicle?  Why  not  purchase  a  2000  car  now,  and  save  the  200-300  per  month?    In  about  a  year  you  could  move  up  to  a  ~5000  car.    You  can  buy  a  pretty  nice  car  for  5K.      Myself,  I  am  on  my  third  year  of  driving  a  4000  car.
386996	I  have  a  colleague  who  always  leases  cars  first.    He's  very  well  off,  has  piles  of  money  in  savings,  owns  a  home,  and  the  cherry  on  top,  he  could  just  write  a  check  for  the  car....      He  sees  the  lease  as  an  insurance  policy  on  the  first  couple  of  years  of  the  car's  life.    If  it  gets  in  an  accident  or  he  finds  something  about  it  he  doesn't  like,  he  can  give  it  back  to  the  dealer  at  the  end  of  the  term  with  no  hassle  and  move  on  to  the  next  car.    Some  people  value  the  fact  that  a  lease  is  a  rental.      If  you're  leasing  a  luxury  car  or  something  you  couldn't  otherwise  afford,  no  amount  of  mental  gymnastics  will  turn  this  in  to  a  good  idea.      Separately,  you  should  never  make  a  down  payment  on  a  lease.    If  the  car  is  totaled  early  on,  you  will  not  recoupe  the  money  you  put  down.    The  issue  here  is  that  while  the  numbers  all  work  out  the  same  between  a  lease  and  a  purchase  your  situation  is  different.    If  the  leased  car  is  totaled,  the  bank  gets  its  money  back  from  an  insurer.    If  that  payment  doesn't  cover  the  value  of  the  car,  the  GAP  insurance  will  cover  it.    In  either  situation,  if  there's  an  excess  remaining  it  will  be  returned  to  you.    The  issue  is  the  excess  may  not  fully  replace  your  down  payment.    If  you  then  went  to  lease  another  car  you  would  need  to  come  up  with  that  down  payment  again  because  you  couldn't  just  simply  choose  to  lease  a  used  car;  like  you  could  in  the  case  of  a  purchase.    Additionally,  GAP  is  generally  included  in  a  lease  whether  you  want  it  or  not.    As  far  as  I'm  concerned  it  doesn't  make  financial  sense  to  mitigate  the  value  of  the  GAP  coverage  once  you've  decided  to  live  in  a  lease  situation.
277003	If  you're  looking  for  cause-effect,  applying  for  another  card  won't  matter  at  all  if  you're  not  paying  any  interest,  or  not  looking  to  get  another  installment  loan  for  which  the  rate  you  get  depends  on  your  credit  rating.  If  you  are  looking  to  get  another  installment  loan,  then  having  more  credit  at  your  disposal  might  hurt  a  small  amount.    I  wouldn't  want  to  cancel  your  oldest  card.    The  GEMB  card  looks  like  a  good  candidate  if  you  want  to  cancel  because  you're  not  using  it,  and  it's  a  relatively  new  card.
12247	You  want  to  have  2-4  credit  cards,  with  a  credit  utilization  ratio  below  30%.    If  you  only  have  2  cards,  closing  1  would  reduce  your  credit  diversity  and  thus  lower  your  credit  score.    You  also  want  at  least  2  years  credit  history,  so  closing  an  older  credit  card  may  shorten  your  credit  history,  again  lowering  your  credit  score.    You  want  to  keep  around  at  least  1-2  older  cards,  even  if  they  are  not  the  best.  You  have  4  cards:  But  having  2-4  cards  (you  have  4)  means  you  can  add  a  5th,  and  then  cancel  one  down  to  4,  or  cancel  one  down  to  3  and  then  add  a  4th,  for  little  net  effect.    Still,  there  will  be  effect,  as  you  have  decreased  the  age  of  your  credit,  and  you  have  opened  new  credit  (always  a  ding  to  your  score).  Do  you  have  installment  loans  (cars),  you  mention  a  new  mortgage,  so  you  need  to  wait  about  3  months  after  the  most  recent  credit  activity  to  let  the  effects  of  that  change  settle.  You  want  both  spouses  to  have  separate  credit  cards,  and  that  will  increase  the  total  available  to  4-8.    That  would  allow  you  to  increase  the  number  of  benefits  available.
435798	Well,  you  won't  be  double  taxed  based  on  what  you  described.  Partners  are  taxed  on  income,  typically  distributions.  Your  gain  in  the  partnership  is  not  income.  However,  you  were  essentially  given  some  money  which  you  elected  to  invest  in  the  partnership,  so  you  need  to  pay  tax  on  that  money.  The  question  becomes,  are  you  being  double  taxed  in  another  way?  Your  question  doesn't  explain  how  you  invested,  but  pretty  much  the  options  are  either  a  payroll  deduction  (some  amount  taken  out  of  X  paychecks  or  a  bonus)  or  some  other  payment  to  you  that  was  not  treated  as  a  payroll  deduction.  Given  that  you  got  a  1099,  that  suggests  the  latter.  However,  if  the  money  was  taken  out  as  a  payroll  deduction  -  you've  already  paid  taxes  (via  your  W2)!  So,  I'd  double  check  on  that.  Regarding  why  the  numbers  don't  exactly  match  up  -  Your  shares  in  the  partnership  likely  transacted  before  the  partnership  valuation.  Let's  illustrate  with  an  example.  Say  the  partnership  is  currently  worth  $1000  with  100  outstanding  shares.  You  put  up  $1000  and  get  100  shares.  Partnership  is  now  worth  $2000  with  200  outstanding  shares.  However,  after  a  good  year  for  the  firm,  it's  valuation  sets  the  firm's  worth  at  $3000.  Your  gain  is  $1500  not  $1000.  You  can  also  see  if  what  happened  was  the  firm's  valuation  went  down,  your  gain  would  be  less  than  your  initial  investment.  If  instead  your  shares  transacted  immediately  after  the  valuation,  then  your  gain  and  your  cost  to  acquire  the  shares  would  be  the  same.  So  again,  I'd  suggest  double  checking  on  this  -  if  your  shares  transacted  after  the  valuation,  there  needs  to  be  an  explanation  for  the  difference  in  your  gain.  For  reference:  http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/incorporation-and-legal-structures/partnership-taxes.html  And  https://www.irs.gov/publications/p541/ar02.html  Here  you  learn  the  purpose  of  the  gain  boxes  on  your  K1  -  tracking  your  capital  basis  should  the  partnership  sell.  Essentially,  when  the  partnership  is  sold,  you  as  a  partner  get  some  money.  That  money  is  then  taxed.  How  much  you  pay  will  depend  on  what  you  received  versus  what  the  company  was  worth  and  whether  your  gain  was  long  term  or  short  term.  This  link  doesn't  go  into  that  detail,  but  should  give  you  a  thread  to  pull.  I'd  also  suggest  reading  more  about  partnerships  and  K1  and  not  just  the  IRS  publications.  Don't  get  me  wrong,  they're  a  good  source  of  information,  just  also  dense  and  sometimes  tough  to  understand.  Good  luck  and  congrats.

It  has  an  import  feature,  but  it  does  not  work  with  all  trading  software.  http://www.google.com/finance  Let  me  know  if  it  works.

505977	I'm  not  familiar  with  QQQ,  but  I'm  guessing  this  is  something  like  IShares  Ftse  100  (see  description  here)
571804	I  searched  for  FTSE  100  fund  on  Yahoo  Finance  and  found  POW  FTSE  RAF  UK  100  (PSRU.L),  among  many  others.    Google  Finance  is  another  possible  source  that  immediately  comes  to  mind.
135022	If  you  are  trading  CFDs,  which  are  usually  traded  on  margin,  you  will  usually  be  charged  an  overnight  financing  fee  for  long  positions  held  overnight  and  you  will  receive  an  overnight  financing  credit  for  short  positions  held  overnight.  Most  CFD  brokers  will  have  their  overnight  financing  rates  set  at  +  or  -  2.5%  or  3%  from  the  country's  official  interest  rates.  So  if  your  country's  official  interest  rate  is  5%  and  your  broker  uses  +  or  -  2.5%,  you  will  get  a  2.5%  credit  for  any  short  positions  held  overnight  and  pay  7.5%  fee  for  any  long  positions  held  overnight.  In  Australia  the  official  interest  rate  is  2.5%,  so  I  get  0%  for  short  positions  and  pay  5%  for  long  positions  held  overnight.  If  you  are  looking  to  hold  positions  open  long  term  (especially  long  positions)  you  might  think  twice  before  using  CFDs  to  trade  as  you  may  end  up  paying  quite  a  bit  in  interest  over  a  long  period  of  time.  These  financing  fees  are  charged  because  you  are  borrowing  the  funds  to  open  your  positions,  If  you  buy  shares  directly  you  would  not  be  charged  such  overnight  financing  fees.
480400	I'll  assume  that  you  would  work  as  a  regular  (part-time)  employee.  In  this  case,  you  are  technically  a  Grenzgänger.  You  will  need  a  specific  kind  of  Swiss  permit  ("Grenzgängerbewilligung")  allowing  you  to  work  in  Switzerland.  Your  employer  typically  takes  care  of  this  -  they  have  more  experience  than  you.  You  being  non-EU  might  make  matters  a  bit  more  complicated.  Your  employer  will  withhold  4.5%  of  your  gross  income  as  source  taxes  ("Quellensteuer").  When  you  do  your  tax  declaration,  your  entire  income  will  be  taxed  in  Germany,  since  this  is  where  you  live.  This  will  happen  after  your  first  year  of  work.  Be  prepared  for  a  large  tax  bill  (or  think  of  this  as  an  interest-free  loan  from  Germany  to  you).  However,  due  to  the  Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen  (DBA),  the  4.5%  you  already  paid  to  Switzerland  will  be  deducted  from  the  taxes  you  are  due  in  Germany.  Judging  from  my  experience,  the  tax  authorities  in  Germany  are  not  fluent  in  the  DBA  -  particularly  in  areas  far  away  from  the  Swiss  border.  I  had  to  gently  remind  them  to  deduct  the  source  taxes,  explicitly  referring  to  the  DBA.  The  bill  was  revised  without  problems,  but  I  strongly  recommend  making  sure  that  your  source  taxes  are  correctly  deducted  from  your  German  tax  liability.  Once  your  local  German  tax  office  understands  your  situation,  you  will  be  asked  to  make  quarterly  prepayments,  which  will  be  calculated  in  a  way  to  minimize  your  later  overall  tax  liability.  Budget  for  these.  You  didn't  ask,  but  I'll  tell  you  anyway:  social  security  will  normally  be  handled  by  Switzerland  as  the  country  of  employment  -  not  the  country  of  residence.  Your  employer  will  automatically  deduct  old  age,  unemployment  and  accident  insurance  and  contribute  to  a  pension  plan,  all  in  Switzerland.  However...  ...  if  you  do  a  lot  of  your  work  in  Germany  (>25%),  which  certainly  applies  if  you  plan  on  mostly  working  remotely,  your  social  security  will  be  handled  by  your  country  of  residence.  This  is  a  major  pain  for  your  employer,  because  now  your  Swiss  employer  needs  to  understand  the  German  social  security  system,  how  much  and  to  whom  to  co-pay  and  so  forth.  This  is  a  major  area  of  study,  and  your  employer  may  not  want  to  spend  all  this  effort.  My  employer  has  looked  at  this  and  requires  anyone  living  outside  of  Switzerland  to  limit  working  from  home  to  less  than  25%,  because  by  extension,  they  would  some  day  also  need  to  do  the  same  for  employees  living  in  France,  Italy,  Austria...  or  even  the  UK.  They  don't  want  to  dig  through  half  the  EU  states'  social  security  regulations.  Therefore,  you  would  not  be  able  to  work  remotely  from  Germany  for  my  employer.  This  is  actually  a  fairly  recent  development  that  only  entered  in  force  at  the  beginning  of  2015  (before  that,  this  was  all  a  bit  of  a  gray  area).  Your  prospective  employer  may  not  be  aware  of  all  details.  So  you  will  need  to  think  about  whether  you  actively  want  to  point  them  at  this  (possibly  ruining  your  plans  of  working  remotely),  or  not  (and  possibly  getting  major  problems  and  post-payments  years  later).  Finally,  I  think  you  can  choose  whether  you  want  to  have  your  health  insurance  in  Switzerland  or  in  Germany  (unless  your  Swiss  obligation  to  be  insured  is  waived  because  of  your  part-time  status).  Some  Swiss  health  insurers  offer  plans  where  they  cooperate  with  German  health  insurers,  so  you  can  go  to  German  doctors  just  like  a  German  resident.  Source:  I  have  been  a  Grenzgänger  from  Germany  into  Switzerland  off  and  on  for  over  ten  years  now.  I  can't  say  anything  about  whether  your  German  visa  restricts  you  from  working  in  Switzerland.  You  may  want  to  ask  about  this  at  Expatriates.SE,  but  I'd  much  rather  ask  your  local  German  authorities  than  random  strangers  on  the  internet.
52882	Finally,  I  got  response  from  finance  center:    "It  doesn't  matter  where  do  you  study,  what  does  matter  is  where  you      live.  So,  once  you  live  in  Germany,  you  pay  taxes  in  Germany.  And      it  doesn't  matter  who  you  work  for."  So,  there  are  two  options  to  pay  taxes:  it's  paid  by  an  employer  or  an  employee:  If  I  would  work  for  Swiss  company,  I  need  to  show  how  much  money  I  make  every  month  (or  year)  to  Finance  Center.
577542	Paying  off  your  loan  in  full  will  most  likely  not  help  your  credit  score,  and  could  potentially  even  hurt  it.  Because  car  loans  are  installment  loans  (and  thus  differ  from  consumer  credit),  lenders  really  only  like  seeing  that  you  responsibly  pay  off  your  loans  on  time.  They  don't  really  care  if  you  pay  it  off  early--lenders  like  seeing  open  lines  of  credit  as  long  as  you  manage  them  well.  The  hard  inquiry  will  simply  lower  your  credit  score  a  few  points  for  up  to  two  years.  So,  from  a  credit  score  perspective,  you're  really  not  going  to  help  yourself  in  this  scenario  (although  it's  not  like  you're  going  to  be  plummeting  yourself  either).
3566	There  are  books  like,  "The  Millionaire  Mind"  that  could  be  of  interest  when  it  comes  to  basics  like  living  below  your  means,  investing  what  you  save,  etc.  that  while  it  is  common  sense,  it  is  uncommonly  done  in  the  world.    Something  to  consider  is  how  actively  do  you  want  your  money  management  to  be?    Is  it  something  to  spend  hours  on  each  week  or  a  few  hours  a  year  tops?    You  have  lots  of  choices  and  decisions  to  make.  I  would  suggest  keeping  part  of  your  savings  as  an  emergency  fund  just  in  case  something  happens.    As  for  another  part,  this  is  where  you  could  invest  in  a  few  different  options  and  see  what  happens.  There  would  be  a  couple  of  different  methods  I  could  see  for  breaking  into  finance  that  I'd  imagine:  IT  of  a  finance  company  -  In  this  case  you'd  likely  be  working  on  customizations  for  what  the  bank,  insurance  or  other  kind  of  financial  firm  requires.    This  could  be  somewhat  boring  as  you  are  basically  a  part  of  the  backbone  that  keeps  the  company  going  but  not  really  able  to  take  much  of  the  glory  when  the  company  makes  a  lot  of  money.  Brains  of  a  hedge  fund  -  In  this  case,  you  may  have  to  know  some  trading  algorithms  and  handle  updating  the  code  so  that  the  trading  activities  can  be  done  by  a  computer  with  lightning  speed.    Harder  to  crack  into  since  these  would  be  the  secretive  people  to  find  and  join  in  a  way.
590874	I  think  "Rich  Dad  Poor  Dad"  is  a  good  read  for  understanding  the  basics  of  personal  finance  in  a  non-technical  format  before  actually  starting  investing.
217521	Also,  my  wealth  manager  doesn't  like  to  discuss  my  money  with  me.  To  some  extent,  I  understand  this  because  finances  are  not  my  forte  This  is  akin  to  porn  surfing  all  day  at  your  job  instead  of  writing  code,  fire  him  ASAP.  For  now  I  would  stick  it  in  a  bank  account  until  you  are  comfortable  and  understand  the  investments  you  are  purchasing.      Here  are  some  options  to  consider:  The  last  one  is  tricky.    You  might  have  to  interview  several  in  order  to  find  that  one  gem.    With  you  being  so  young  it  is  unlikely  any  of  your  friends  have  a  need  for  such  a  service.    I  would  concentrate  on  asking  older  work  colleagues  or  friends  of  your  parents  for  recommendations.    Ask  if  they  are  educated  by  their  adviser.      In  the  end  it  would  really  pay  for  you  to  educate  yourself  about  finances.    No  one  can  quite  do  as  good  as  a  job  as  you  can  in  this  area.    You  recognize  that  there  was  a  problem  with  your  current  guy,  that  shows  wisdom.    If  you  have  an  interest  in  this  area,  I  would  recommend  attending  a  Financial  Peace  University  class.    All  my  kids  (about  your  age  and  older)  are  required  to  take  it.    It  will  help  you  navigate  debt,  mortgages,  insurance,  and  investing  and  will  cost  you  about  $100.    If  you  don't  learn  enough  the  first  time,  and  you  won't,  you  can  repeat  the  course  as  many  times  as  you  wish  for  no  additional  cost.
343206	Look  through  the  related  questions.    Make  sure  you  fund  the  max  your  tax  advantaged  retirement  funds  will  take  this  year.    Use  the  30k  to  backstop  any  shortfalls.    Invest  the  rest  in  a  brokerage  account.  In  and  out  of  your  tax  advantaged  accounts,  try  to  invest  in  index  funds.    Your  feeling  that  paying  someone  to  manage  your  investments  might  not  be  the  best  use  is  shared  by  many.    jlcollinsnh  is  a  financial  independence  blogger.    He,  and  many  others,  recommend  the  Vanguard  Total  Stock  Market  Index  Admiral  Shares.    I  have  not  heard  of  a  lower  expense  ratio  (0.05%).  Search  for  financial  independence  and  FIRE  (Financial  Independence  Retire  Early).    Use  your  windfall  to  set  yourself  on  that  road,  and  you  will  be  less  likely  to  sit  where  I  am  25  years  from  now  wishing  you  had  done  things  differently.  Edit:    Your  attitude  should  be  that  the  earliest  money  in  your  portfolio  is  in  there  the  longest,  and  earns  the  most.    Starting  with  a  big  windfall  puts  you  years  ahead  of  where  you'd  normally  be.    If  you  set  your  goal  to  retire  at  40,  that  money  will  be  worth  significantly  more  in  20  years.  (4x  what  you  start  with,  assuming  7%  average  yearly  return).
47973	First,  I  applaud  you  for  caring.    Most  people  don't!    In  fact,  I  was  in  that  category.      You  bring  up  several  issues  and  I'll  try  to  address  them  separately.  (1)  Getting  a  financial  planner  to  talk  with  you.    I  had  the  same  experience!    My  belief  is  that  they  don't  want  to  admit  that  they  don't  know  how  things  work.  I  even  asked  if  I  could  pay  them  an  hourly  fee  to  ask  questions  and  review  stocks  with  them.    Most  declined.    You'll  find  that  very  few  people  actually  take  the  time  to  get  trained  to  evaluate  stocks  and  the  stock  market  as  a  whole.    (See  later  Investools.com).  After  looking,  however,  I  did  find  people  who  would  spend  an  hour  or  two  with  me  when  we  met  once  a  quarter  to  review  my  "portfolio"/investments.    I  later  found  training  that  companies  offered.    I  would  attend  any  free  training  I  could  get  because  they  actually  wanted  to  spend  time  and  talk  and  teach  investors.  Bottom  line  is:  Talking  to  their  clients  is  the  job  of  a  financial  planner.    If  he  (or  she)  is  not  willing  to  take  this  time,  it  is  in  your  best  interest  to  find  someone  who  will  spend  that  time.  (2)  Learning  about  investing!  I'm  not  affiliated  with  anyone.    I'm  a  software  developer  and  I  do  my  own  trading/investments.    The  opinions  I  share  are  my  own.  When  I  was  20  years  away  from  retirement,  I  started  learning  about  the  stock  market  so  that  I  would  know  how  it  worked  before  I  retired  so  that  (a)  I  could  influence  a  change  if  one  was  needed,  and  (b)  so  I  wouldn't  have  to  blindly  accept  the  advice  of  the  "experts"  even  when  the  stock  market  is  crashing.  I  have  used  Investools.com,  and  TDAmeritrade's  Think-or-Swim  platform.    I've  learned  a  tremendous  amount  from  the  Investools  training.    I  recommend  them.    But  don't  expect  to  learn  how  to  get  rich  from  them  or  any  training  you  take.  The  TDA  Think-or-swim  platform  I  highly  recommend  BECAUSE  it  has  a  feature  called  "Paper  Money".    It  lets  you  trade  using  the  real  market  but  with  play  money.    I  highly  recommend  ANY  platform  that  you  can  use  to  trade  IN  PAPER  money!  The  think-or-swim  platform  would  allow  you  to  invest  $30,000  in  paper  money  (you  can  have  as  much  as  you  want)  into  any  stock.    This  would  let  you  see  if  you  can  make  more  money  than  your  current  investment  advisor.    You  could  invest  $10K  in  one  SPY,  $10K  in  DIA  and  $10K  in  IWM  (these  are  symbols  for  the  S&P  500,  Dow  30,  and  Small  Cap  stocks).    This  is  just  an  example,  I'm  not  suggesting  any  investment  advise!  It's  important  that  you  actually  do  this  not  just  write  down  on  a  piece  of  paper  or  Excel  spreadsheet  what  you  were  going  to  do  because  it's  common  to  "cheat"  and  change  the  dates  to  meet  your  needs.    I  have  found  it  incredibly  helpful  to  understand  how  the  market  works  by  trying  to  do  my  own  paper  and  now  real  money  investing.  I  was  and  you  will  be  surprised  to  find  that  many  trades  lose  money  during  the  initial  start  part  of  the  trade  because  it's  very  difficult  to  buy  at  the  exact  right  time.  An  important  part  of  managing  your  own  investments  is  learning  to  trade  with  rules  and  not  get  "emotionally  involved"  in  your  trades.  (3)  Return  on  investment.  You  were  not  happy  with  $12  return.    Low  returns  are  a  byproduct  of  the  way  most  investment  firms  (financial  planners)  take  (diversification).    They  diversify  to  take  a  "hands  off"  approach  toward  investment  because  that  approach  has  been  the  only  approach  that  they  have  found  that  works  relatively  well  in  all  market  conditions.    It's  not  (necessarily)  a  bad  approach.    It  avoids  large  losses  in  down  markets  (most  riskier  approaches  lose  more  than  the  market).    The  downside  is  it  also  avoids  the  high  returns.    If  the  market  goes  up  15%  the  investment  might  only  go  up  5%.  30K  is  enough  to  give  to  multiple  investment  firms  a  try.    I  gave  two  different  firms  $25K  each  to  see  how  they  would  invest.    The  direction  was  to  accept  LOTS  of  risk  (with  the  potential  for  large  losses  or  large  gains).  In  a  year  that  the  market  did  very  well,  one  lost  money,  and  one  made  a  small  gain.    It  was  a  learning  experience.    I,  now,  have  taken  the  money  back  and  invest  it  myself.  NOTE:  I  would  be  happy  with  a  guy  who  made  me  10-15%  year  over  year  (in  good  times  and  bad)  and  didn't  talk  with  me,  but  I  haven't  found  someone  who  can  do  that.  :-)  NOTE  2:  Don't  believe  what  you  hear  from  the  news  about  the  stock  market  being  up  5%  year  to  date.    Do  your  own  analysis.  NOTE  3:  Investing  in  "the  market"  (S&P  500  for  example)  is  a  great  way  to  go  if  you're  just  starting.    Few  investment  firms  can  beat  "the  market"  although  many  try  to  do  so.    I  too  have  found  it's  easier  to  do  that  than  other  approaches  I've  learned.    So,  it  might  be  a  good  long  term  approach  as  well.  Best  wishes  to  you  in  your  learning  about  the  market  and  desires  to  make  money  with  your  money.    That  is  what  is  all  about.
485243	Many  people  have  provided  very  good  answers  to  this  question  and  all  the  answers  provide  sound  advice  and  justification.  Below  are  some  of  my  thoughts  on  the  questions  that  you  have  put  forward.  1)  The  investment  manager  question:  The  returns  on  your  capital  for  a  half  year  has  been  quite  low;  having  said  that,  some  investments  do  take  more  than  half  year  to  show  some  growth.  You  could  try  talking  to  your  investment  manager  and  ask  where  your  money  has  been  deployed  and  why  the  returns  are  low.  If  there  are  no  real  explanation  given  forth  (which  would  be  more  likely  as  you  have  mentioned  your  investment  manager  does  not  like  to  discuss  your  money  with  you)  you  should  conside  Xolorus  &  Pete's  advice  and  forthwith  take  all  your  money  from  investment  manager  and  park  it  in  the  bank  till  you  figure  out  what  to  do  next  with  it.  2)  Finances  are  not  my  forte:  At  22  finance  is  nobodies  forte,  it  takes  longer  than  that;  however  having  said  that,  how  do  you  know  finance  is  actually  not  your  forte?  Being  a  computer  science  graduate  you  would  be  more  than  comfortable  with  the  mathematics  required  for  finance.  You  may  not  have  looked  seriously  at  finance  till  now  (I  assume  by  your  statement).  Once  way  to  be  certain  about  this  would  be  self  learning,  some  good  books  have  been  refered  above  and  there  are  online  information,  courses  and  articles  on  the  Internet,  for  example  here.  You  could  give  some  spare  time  and  explore  if  finance  interests  you  or  not.  3)  If  finance  interests  you:  Then  consider  the  30K  as  your  seed  fund  and  take  a  small  portion  of  it  say  2K  and  try  out  your  hand  at  investing  on  your  own  in  the  instruments  that  you  feel  most  comfortable  and  see  how  you  fare,  you  are  young  enough  to  take  the  risk.  Rest  of  the  money  you  could  put  in  other  low  risk  instruments  (that  you  have  identified  through  self  study)  4)  If  finance  does  not  interest  you:  The  probably  you  are  better  off  with  an  investment  manager,  as  observed  above,  it  will  take  some  time  for  you  to  identify  him/her  5)  On  returns:  As  mentioned  above  different  instruments  produce  returns  differently,  however,  one  question  that  is  universally  asked  is  how  much  return  on  an  invetment  shoule  one  expect  (you  were  expecting  more  than  $12  on  your  investment).  It  is  a  difficult  question  to  answer  as  invetment  returns  and  investment  needs  depend  on  a  persons  financial  goals  and  risk  taking  profile.  One  way  to  have  some  measure  is  to  take  15-20  years  CAGR  of  the  stock  index  return  and  reduce  it  by  2-3%,  that  is  (in  many  cases,  not  all)  a  reasonable  return  expectation  in  medium-long  term.
13975	Imagine  that,  a  car  dealership  lied  to  someone  trusting.    Who  would  have  thought.  A  big  question  is  how  well  do  you  get  along  with  your  "ex"?    Can  you  be  in  the  same  room  without  fighting?    Can  you  agree  on  things  that  are  mutually  beneficial?  The  car  will  have  to  be  paid  off,  and  taken  out  of  his  name.    The  mechanics  on  how  to  do  this  is  a  bit  tricky  and  you  may  want  to  see  a  lawyer  about  it.        Having  you  being  the  sole  owner  of  the  car  benefits  him  because  he  is  no  longer  a  cosigner  on  a  loan.    This  will  help  him  get  additional  loans  if  he  chooses,  or  cosign  on  his  next  gf's  car.  And  of  course  this  benefits  you  as  you  "own"  the  car  instead  of  both  of  you.  You  will  probably  have  to  refinance  the  car  in  your  name  only.    Do  you  have  sufficient  credit?    Once  this  happens  can  you  pay  off  the  car  in  like  a  year  or  so?  If  you  search  this  site  a  similar  questions  is  asked  about  once  per  month.    Car  loans  are  pretty  terrible,  in  the  future  you  should  avoid  them.    Cosigning  is  even  worse  and  you  should  never  again  participate  in  such  a  thing.  Another  option  is  to  just  sell  the  car  and  start  over  with  your  own  car  hopefully  paid  for  in  cash.
507813	Your  best  bet  is  to  refinance  the  car  in  your  own  name  only.  Hopefully  a  year  of  making  the  payments  has  improved  your  credit  score  enough.  If  not,  you  can  approach  a  loan  officer  at  a  credit  union  and  make  your  case  (that  you  haven't  missed  any  payments,  etc.).  A  new  title  should  be  sent  to  the  new  lien  holder,  and    in  that  process,  if  your  ex  needs  to  sign  any  paperwork,  it  can  be  done  while  refinancing.
368802	You  are  co-signer  on  his  car  loan.  You  have  no  ownership  (unless  the  car  is  titled  in  both  names).    One  option  (not  the  best,  see  below)  is  to  buy  the  car  from  him.    Arrange  your  own  financing  (take  over  his  loan  or  get  a  loan  of  your  own  to  pay  him  for  the  car).    The  bank(s)  will  help  you  take  care  of  getting  the  title  into  your  name.    And  the  bank  holding  the  note  will  hold  the  title  as  well.  Best  advice  is  to  get  with  him,  sell  the  car.  Take  any  money  left  after  paying  off  the  loan  and  use  it  to  buy  (cash  purchase,  not  finance)  a  reliable,  efficient,  used  car  --  if  you  truly  need  a  car  at  all.  If  you  can  get  to  work  by  walking,  bicycling  or  public  transit,  you  can  save  thousands  per  year,  and  perhaps  use  that  money  to  start  you  down  the  road  to  "financial  independence".    Take  a  couple  of  hours  and  research  this.    In  the  US,  we  tend  to  view  cars  as  necessary,  but  this  is  not  always  true.    (Actually,  it's  true  less  than  half  the  time.)  Even  if  you  cannot,  or  choose  not  to,  live  within  bicycle  distance  of  work,  you  can  still  reduce  your  commuting  cost  by  not  financing,  and  by  driving  a  fuel  efficient  vehicle.    Ask  yourself,  "Would  you  give  up  your  expensive  vehicle  if  it  meant  retiring  years  earlier?"    Maybe  as  many  as  ten  years  earlier.
299811	A  mortgage  lender  will  not  usually  lend  more  than  they  could  get  if  they  had  to  repossess  the  property  and  sell  it  to  recover  their  investment  (in  the  U.S.  it  is  generally  accepted  that  80%  of  market  value  is  the  golden  number  that  makes  the  mortgage  work).    That's  why  an  appraisal  is  required.  Even  with  50%  down,  the  numbers  might  not  add  up  if  your  property  is  appraised  very  low  (extremely  unlikely,  though.  It's  more  likely  your  realtor  is  inexperienced).
597265	My  realtor  told  me  that  even  though  they're  only  asking  for  1/2        the  money  and  have  excellent  credit  that  the  mortgage  company  may      not  lend  it  to  them  if  I'm  over  priced.  Is  this  true?  I've  never  heard  of  it  before.  It  is  a  chance,  but  it  is  a  red  herring  to  the  discussion.  Having  excellent  credit  has  nothing  to  do  with  being  eligible  for  a  debt  object  of  a  specific  size.  Just  because  you  have  excellent  credit,  would  you  get  approved  for  a  property  of  $10,000,000  if  you  only  made  $35,000  a  year  (and  had  no  other  net  worth)?  But  regarding  your  potential  buyers,  a  chance  vs  a  good  chance  is  different.  Your  realtor  just  told  you  some  basic  always  true  lending  fact  that  has  nothing  to  do  with  your  situation.
26655	even  though  they're  only  asking  for  1/2  the  money  and  have  excellent  credit  that  the  mortgage  company  may  not  lend  it  to  them  if  I'm  over  priced  Yes.  If  the  house's  value,  as  determined  by  the  appraisal,  is  less  than  the  sale  price,  the  bank  will  not  finance  the  loan.  Appraisals  and  the  appraisal  process  have  become  much  tighter  since  the  Frannie  and  Freddie  debacle.  This  fact  is  true  regardless  of  amounts  or  credit  history.  Though  this  is  happens  somewhat  rarely;  typically  if  a  seller  and  buyer  agree  to  a  price,  this  price  is  a  reasonable  value  --  after  all,  that  is  nearly  the  definition  of  "market  value".  So,  yes,  it  is  true  (and  always  true,  for  any  financed  purchase),  but  that  shouldn't  really  affect  your  decision.  If  you  try  to  sell  for  more  than  the  appraisal,  you  will  just  lower  the  price  to  the  appraised  amount.
457811	Mutual  funds  don't  have  intraday  prices.  They  have  net  asset  values  which  are  calculated  periodically  (daily  or  weekly  or  any  other  period  depending  on  the  fund).
384265	This  idea  does  not  make  sense  for  most  mutual  funds.  The  net  asset  value,  or  NAV,  is  the  current  market  value  of  a  fund's  holdings,  minus  the  fund's  liabilities,  that  is  usually  expressed  as  a  per-share  amount.  For  most  funds,  the  NAV  is  determined  daily,  after  the  close  of  trading  on  some  specified  financial  exchange,  but  some  funds  update  their  NAV  multiple  times  during  the  trading  day.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund  I  am  not  certain,  but  I  believe  that  OppenheimerFunds  does  not  report  intraday  prices.    I  would  call  them  up  and  ask.
285466	Like  others  have  said,  mutual  funds  don't  have  an  intraday  NAV,  but  their  ETF  equivalents  do.  Use  something  like  Yahoo  Finance  and  search  for  the  ETF.IV.  For  example  VOO.IV.  This  will  give  you  not  the  ETF  price  (which  may  be  at  a  premium  or  discount),  but  the  value  of  the  underlying  securities  updated  every  15  seconds.
367071	Look  at  morningstar  holdings.It  will  list  the  top  25  holdings  and  their  current  price.This  will  give  you  a  good  idea  of  the  intra-day  price  of  the  fund.
24979	There  is  most  likely  an  error  in  the  WSJ's  data.    Yahoo!  Finance  reports  the  P/E  on  the  Russell  2000  to  be  15  as  of  8/31/11  and  S&P  500  P/E  to  be  13  (about  the  same  as  WSJ).  Good  catch,  though!    E-mail  WSJ,  perhaps  they  will  be  grateful.
164555	In  simple  terms  :  Equity  Loan  is  money  borrowed  from  the  bank  to  buy  assets  which  can  be  houses  ,  shares  etc  Protected  equity  loan  is  commonly  used  in  shares  where  you  have  a  portfolio  of  shares  and  you  set  the  minimum  value  the  portfolio  can  fall  to  .  Anything  less  than  there  may  result  in  a  sell  off  of  the  share  to  protect  you  from  further  capital  losses.    This  is  a  very  brief  explaination  ,  which  does  not  fully  cover  what  Equity  Loan  &&  Protected  Equity  Loan  really  mean
178028	Assuming  the  numbers  you  gave  are  forecasted  2013  annual  income,  you  should  really  use  an  average  and  give  the  lender  1  number,  as  long  as  you  can  provide  documentation  to  back  it  up.  Lenders  aren't  as  sophisticated  as  considering  your  monthly  income  fluctuations  into  their  underwriting  algorithm.    If  you're  not  tied  down  to  your  existing  lender,  I  highly  recommend  you  to  shop  around.  There  isn't  an  "universal  lending  requirement".  You'll  be  surprised  at  how  flexible  they  are.  Not  as  a  recommendation  to  get  around  the  rules,  but  just  finding  a  lender  that'll  work  with  your  situation.  Try  personal  finance  forums  such  as  FatWallet  or  Slickdeal  to  find  low-cost  lenders:  http://goo.gl/vIojT
252859	Considering  I'm  putting  30%  down  and  having  my  father  cosign  is  there      any  chance  I  would  be  turned  down  for  a  loan  on  a  $100k  car?  According  to  BankRate,  the  average  credit  score  needed  to  buy  a  new  car  is  714,  but  they  also  show  average  interest  rates  at  6.39%  for  new-car  loans  to  people  with  credit  scores  in  the  601-660  range.  High  income  certainly  helps  offset  credit  score  to  some  extent.    Not  every  bank/dealership  does  things  the  same  way.  Being  self-employed  you'd  most  likely  be  required  to  show  2  years  of  tax  returns,  and  they'd  use  those  as  a  basis  for  your  income  rather  than  whatever  you  have  made  recently.  If  using  a  co-signer,  their  income  matters.  Another  key  factor  is  debt  to  income  ratio,  if  too  much  of  someone's  income  is  already  spoken  for  by  other  debts  a  lender  will  shy  away.  So,  yes,  there's  a  chance,  given  all  the  information  we  don't  know  and  the  variability  with  lender  policies,  that  you  could  be  turned  down  for  a  car  loan.  How  should  I  go  about  this?  If  you're  set  on  pursuing  the  car  loan,  just  go  talk  to  some  lenders.  You'll  want  to  shop  around  for  a  good  rate  anyway,  so  no  need  to  speculate  just  go  find  out.  Include  the  dealership  as  a  potential  financing  option,  they  can  have  great  rates.  Personally,  I'd  get  a  much  cheaper  car.  Your  insurance  premium  on  a  100k  car  will  be  quite  high  due  to  your  age.  You  might  be  rightly  confident  in  your  earning  potential,  but  nothing  is  guaranteed,  situations  can  change  wildly  in  short  order.  A  new  car  is  not  a  good  investment  or  a  value-retaining  asset,  so  why  bother  going  into  debt  for  one  if  you  don't  have  to?  If  you  buy  something  in  cash  now,  you  could  upgrade  in  a  few  years  without  financing  if  your  earning  prediction  holds  and  would  save  quite  a  bit  in  car  insurance  and  interest  over  the  years  between.
127487	There  is  no  difference  between  more  shares  of  a  relatively  cheaper  stock  and  less  shares  of  a  relatively  more  expensive  stock.  When  you  invest  in  a  stock,  the  percentage  increase  (or  decrease)  in  the  share  price  results  in  gains  (or  losses).  This  is  a  fundamental  concept  of  investing.  Your  question  suggests  that  you  would  benefit  from  further  research  before  investing  your  money.  Trading  real  dollars  can  be  difficult  without  a  strong  understanding  of  the  principles  involved.  Investing  your  money  without  a  good  knowledge  base  will  likely  be  stressful  and  could  have  a  discouraging  effect  if  it  doesn't  go  well.  Before  you  open  an  investment  account,  read  up  on  investing  fundamentals,  particularly  mutual  funds  as  those  can  be  a  great  place  to  start  as  a  new  investor.  There  are  many  sources  of  information  including  books,  websites  such  as  http://investor.gov/investing-basics  and  this  website.  Don't  skip  the  sections  on  taxes,  as  those  matter  just  as  much  and  sometimes  more  than  the  simple  buying  and  selling.  You  might  look  at  tax  advantaged  accounts,  such  as  401k's,  IRA's,  etc.    It  shouldn't  take  long  but  it  will  be  one  of  the  most  important  things  you  do  as  a  beginning  investor.  Everyone  has  to  start  here.  Understanding  the  vocabulary  and  concepts  will  likely  save  you  time  and  money  throughout  your  investing  life.
373204	Unless  your  brokerage  will  sell  you  fractional  shares,  the  most  obvious  difference  (without  us  knowing  the  actual  identify  of  the  companies)  is  that  with  the  $260  one,  you  will  have  3  shares  plus  you  will  have  $220  minus  commission  left  over  that  you  wanted  to  invest  but  weren't  able  to  simply  because  of  the  mechanics  of  long  division.  You  could  put  that  $220  into  one  of  the  cheaper  stocks,  but  now  the  multiple  commissions  will  start  to  eat  your  returns.  My  personal  opinion  is  you  should  go  for  a  low  cost  index  mutual  fund  or  ETF,  and  wait  to  pick  individual  stocks  until  you  have  more  than  $1000  to  work  with  (and  even  then,  probably  still  go  with  the  low  cost  index  fund)
111827	You  are  correct  in  thinking  actual  number  of  shares  do  not  matter,  the  value  is  the  value.      However  there  are  cases  where  share  price  does  play  a  role.    Berkshire  Hathaway  for  example  has  not  split  because  Warren  Buffet  believes  it  has  cut  down  on  the  liquidity  of  the  stock,  as  well  as  attracting  investors  with  an  eye  for  the  longer  term.      There  have  also  been  things  written  on  the  psychology  of  a  share  price.  For  example,  some  people  are  attracted  to  shares  that  split,  because  it  reflects  a  company  is  growing.
34882	Open  Google  finance  and  divide  the  Market  Capitalization  by  the  total  price.  That  will  give  you  the  total  number  of  shares  outstanding.  Now  see  the  number  of  shares  you  could  buy  for  $1000(40  shares  of  $25  each  or  10  shares  of  100  shares  each).  Now  divide  the  number  of  shares  you  own,  by  the  number  of  shares  outstanding  in  the  company  and  multiply  it  by  100(i.e  (Shares  you  own/shares  Outstanding)  *  100).  That  will  give  you  the  percentage  or  stake  of  the  company  you  own(With  $1000,  don't  expect  it  to  be  a  very  large  number).  Now  ask  your  self  the  question,  Is  it  worth  it  if  I  can  buy  x  %  of  this  company  for  $1000?  If  the  answer  is  yes,  go  ahead  and  buy  it.    To  answer  your  question  in  short,  NO!  it  does  not  matter  whether  you  buy  10  shares  for  $100  or  40  shares  for  $25.  Cheers
421992	I  was  thinking  that  the  value  of  the  stock  is  the  value  of  the  stock...the  actual  number  of  shares  really  doesn't  matter,  but  I'm  not  sure.  You're  correct.    Share  price  is  meaningless.      Google  is  $700  per  share,  Apple  is  $100  per  share,  that  doesn't  say  anything  about  either  company  and/or  whether  or  not  one  is  a  better  investment  over  the  other.  You  should  not  evaluate  an  investment  decision  on  price  of  a  share.    Look  at  the  books  decide  if  the  company  is  worth  owning,  then  decide  if  it's  worth  owning  at  it's  current  price.
591230	No,  and  using  a  37  year  old  formula  in  finance  that  is  as  simple  as:  should  make  it  obvious  technical  analysis  is  more  of  a  game  for  retail  traders  than  investment  advice.  When  it  comes  to  currencies,  there  are  a  myriad  of  macroeconomic  occurrences  that  do  not  follow  a  predictable  timescale.  Using  indicators  like  RSI  on  any  time  frame  will  not  magically  illuminate  broad  human  psychology  and  give  you  an  edge.  It  is  theoretically  possible  for  a  single  public  stock's  price  to  be  driven  by  a  range  of  technical  traders  who  all  buy  at  RSI  30  and  sell  at  RSI  70,  after  becoming  a  favorite  stock  on  social  media,  but  it  is  infinitely  more  likely  for  all  market  participants  to  have  completely  different  goals.
301570	No.  The  long-term  valuation  of  currencies  has  to  do  with  Purchasing  Power  Parity.    The  long-term  valuation  of  stocks  has  to  do  with  revenues,  expenses,  market  sizes,  growth  rates,  and  interest  rates.  In  the  short  term,  currency  and  stock  prices  change  for  many  reasons,  including  interest  rate  changes,  demand  for  goods  and  services,  asset  price  changes,  political  fears,  and  momentum  investing.    In  any  given  time  window,  a  currency  or  stock  might  be:  The  Relative  Strength  Index  tries  to  say  whether  a  currency  or  stock  has  recently  been  rising  or  falling;  it  does  not  inherently  say  anything  about  whether  the  current  value  is  high  or  low.
524789	I  agree  that  a  random  page  on  the  internet  is  not  always  a  good  source,  but  at  the  same  time  I  will  use  Google  or  Yahoo  Finance  to  look  up  US/EU  equities,  even  though  those  sites  are  not  authoritative  and  offer  zero  guarantees  as  to  the  accuracy  of  their  data.  In  the  same  vein  you  could  try  a  website  devoted  to  warrants  in  your  market.    For  example,  I  Googled  toronto  stock  exchange  warrants  and  the  very  first  link  took  me  to  a  site  with  all  the  information  you  mentioned.    The  authoritative  source  for  the  information  would  be  the  listing  exchange,  but  I've  spent  five  minutes  on  the  TSX  website  and  couldn't  find  even  a  fraction  of  the  information  about  that  warrant  that  I  found  on  the  non-authoritative  site.
395812	This  is  where  an  insurance  agent  is  very  useful.  They  will  help  you  choose  appropriate  coverage,  based  on  local  rebuilding  costs,  the  build  quality  of  your  house  (higher  quality  or  historic/semi-historic  construction  requires  a  different  type  of  coverage),  etc.  They  can  also  help  advise  you  on  things  like  the  need  for  flood  insurance,  etc.  Local  rules  can  vary,  and  the  local  agent  will  know  about  them.  For  example,  we  found  out  that  my  home  was  in  a  semi-historic  district,  which  requires  using  higher-cost  materials  for  reconstruction.  Also,  our  city  separately  licenses  tradespeople,  who  tend  to  be  unionized  and  thus  more  expensive.  Had  I  just  picked  default  coverages,  I  would  have  been  in  a  pickle  in  the  event  of  a  loss.
138696	Never  take  the  first  quote.  Consider  what  it  would  really  cost  to  replace  the  house  --  to  rebuild  and  pay  for  living  while  you  do  so  (including  demolition,  etc.)  and/or  pay  off  the  mortgage  and  return  your  equity  if  it  is  a  financed  property.    Most  insurances  will  have  a  limit  on  how  much  coverage  you  can  get  based  on  the  property  value  and  your  goods  value  estimates.    Shop  around  for  a  company  that  will  give  you  a  good  price  but  also  good  customer  service  and  a  smooth  claims  process.    They  should  be  solvent  (able  to  pay  your  claim  if,  say,  a  tornado  hit  the  whole  neighborhood).    And  they  should  cover  your  reasonable  replacement  costs.  And  remember,  insurance  is  about  the  big  losses  like  fires.  Know  what  you  are  comfortable  self  insuring  (higher  or  lower  deductibles,  optional  coverages,  etc.)  and  you  will  have  an  easier  time  getting  the  coverage  you  need  for  the  price  you  want  to  pay.
484291	You  can't  compare  the  different  quotes  unless  they  have  the  same  numbers  to  work  with.  The  big  companies  should  use  similar  models  to  come  up  with  values  for  the  contents.  In  many  cases  they  will  assume  some  standard  values  for  things  like  appliances.  Yes  you  have  a  stove,  but  unless  it  is  commercial  grade  they  won't  care  when  giving  you  a  quote.  If  you  have  very  expensive  items  you  may  need  a  rider  to  cover  them.  There  is  not  relationship  between  the  county  assessment  and  the  cost  to  rebuild.  The  insurance  doesn't  cover  the  land.  You  have  to  make  sure  that  all  quotes  include  the  same  riders:  cost  to  put  you  in  a  motel,  flood  insurance...  and  the  same  deductibles.  Your  state  may  have  an  insurance  office  that  can  help  answer  your  question.    Here  is  the  one  for  Virginia.
113844	It  reminds  me  of  the  Efficient  Market  Hypothesis,  except  that  just  states  in  its  weakest  form  that  the  current  market  price  accounts  for  all  information  embedded  in  previous  market  prices.  In  other  words,  people  buying  today  at  42  know  it  was  selling  for  40  yesterday,  and  the  patterns  and  such.  To  say  that  stock  is  memoryless  strikes  me  as  not  quite  right  --  to  the  extent  that  stocks  are  valued  based  on  earnings,  much  of  what  we  infer  about  future  earnings  relies  on  past  and  present  earnings.  One  obvious  counterexample  to  this  "memoryless"  claim  is  bankruptcy.  If  a  stock  files  bankruptcy,  and  there  isn't  enough  money  to  pay  senior  debt,  your  shares  are  worth  0  in  perpetuity.
511159	I  think  that  "memoryless"  in  this  context  of  a  given  stock's  performance  is  not  a  term  of  art.  IMO,  it's  an  anecdotal  concept  or  cliche  used  to  make  a  point  about  holding  a  stock.  Sometimes  people  get  stuck...  they  buy  a  stock  or  fund  at  50,  it  goes  down  to  30,  then  hold  onto  it  so  they  can  "get  back  to  even".  By  holding  the  loser  stock  for  emotional  reasons,  the  person  potentially  misses  out  on  gains  elsewhere.
90603	This  is  an  interesting  question  that  may  actually  be  better  suited  to  Quant.SE.  First  of  all,  stock  prices  are  random  variables,  or,  to  be  more  precise,  stochastic  processes  (a  time-ordered  string  of  random  variables).    The  alternative  to  being  stochastic  is  being  deterministic,  and  I  doubt  you  believe  that  stock  prices  are  deterministic  (meaning,  they  are  fully  knowable  in  advance).    The  fact  that  real  world  events  drive  the  randomness  has  no  bearing  on  whether  or  not  it  is  random.    So,  to  start,  I  think  you  have  confused  the  technical  definition  of  random  with  a  colloquial  concept.  Now,  the  heart  of  the  question  is  whether  stock  prices  are  memoryless.    Ultimately,  this  is  an  empirical  question  that  has  been  addressed  in  many  academic  studies.    The  conclusion  of  most  of  this  research  is  that  stock  prices  are  "almost"  memoryless,  in  the  sense  that  the  distribution  of  future  stock  prices  displays  very  little  dependence  upon  past  realizations,  although  a  few  persistent  anomalies  remain.    One  of  the  most  robust  deviations  from  memorylessness  is  the  increase  in  the  volatility  of  a  stock  following  large  declines.    Another  is  persistence  in  volatility.    In  general,  in  fact,  the  volatility  is  far  more  predictable  than  the  mean  of  stock  price  changes.    Hence  "memorylessness"  is  a  far  stronger  assumption  than  the  efficient  markets  hypothesis.  The  bottom  line,  however,  is  that  the  deviations  from  memorylessness  are  relatively  small.    As  such,  despite  its  limitations,  it  is  a  decent  working  assumption  in  some  contexts.
535470	With  my  current,  limited  knowledge  (see  end),  I  understand  it  the  following  way:  Are  share  prices  really  described  as  "memoryless"?    Yes.    Is  there  a      technical  meaning  of  the  term?  What  does  it  really  mean?  The  meaning  comes  from  Markov  Models:  Think  of  the  behavior  of  the  stock  market  over  time  as  a  Markov  Chain,  i.e.  a  probabilistic  model  with  states  and  probabilistic  transitions.  A  state  is  the  current  price  of  all  stocks  of  the  market,  a  transition  is  a  step  in  time.  Memoryless  means  that  transitions  that  the  stock  market  might  make  can  be  modelled  by  a  relation  from  one  state  to  another,  i.e.  it  only  depends  on  the  current  state.  The  model  is  a  Markov  Chain,  as  opposed  to  a  more  general  Stochastic  Process  where  the  next  state  depends  on  more  than  the  current  state.  So  in  a  Markov  Chain,  all  the  history  of  one  stock  is  "encoded"  already  in  its  current  price  (more  precisely  in  all  stock's  prices).    The  memorylessness  of  stocks  is  the  main  statement  of  the  Efficient  Market  Theory  (EMT).  If  a  company's  circumstances  don't  change,  then  a  drop  in  its  share  price  is  going  to  be  followed  by  a  rise  later.    So  if  the  EMT  holds,  your  statement  above  is  not  necessarily  true.  I  personally  belief  the  EMT  is  a  good  approximation  -  only  large  corporations  (e.g.  Renaissance  Technologies)  have  enough  ressources  (hundreds  of  mathematicians,  billions  of  $)  to  be  able  to  leverage  tiny  non-random  movements  that  stem  from  a  not  completely  random,  mostly  chaotic  market.    The  prices  can  of  course  change  when  the  company's  circumstances  change,  but  they  aren't  "memoryless"  either.  A  company's  future  state  is  influenced  by  its  past.  In  the  EMT,  a  stock's  future  state  is  only  influenced  by  its  past  as  much  as  is  encoded  in  its  current  price  (more  precisely,  the  complete  market's  current  state).  Whether  that  price  was  reached  by  a  drop  or  a  rise  makes  no  difference.    The  above  is  my  believe,  but  I'm  by  far  no  finance  expert.  I  am  working  professionally  with  probabilistic  models,  but  have  only  read  one  book  on  finance:  Kommer's  "Souverän  investieren  mit  Indexfonds  und  ETFs".  It's  supposed  to  contain  many  statements  of  Malkiel's  "A  Random  Walk  Down  Wall  Street".
535793	@jidugger  mostly  got  it  right.  It  basically  mean  that  past  performance  of  a  stock,  or  a  basket  of  stocks,  are  not  at  all  useful  when  trying  to  predict  its  future.  There  is  no  proven  correlation  between  past  and  future  performance.  If  there  was  such  a  correlation,  that  was  "proven"  or  known,  then  investors  would  quickly  exploit  this  correlation  by  buying  or  selling  this  stock,  thus  nullifying  the  prediction.  It  doesn't  mean  the  specific  individuals  cannot  predict  the  future  stock  market  -  hell,  if  I  set  up  2^100  different  robots,  where  every  robots  gives  a  different  series  of  answers  to  the  100  questions  "how  will  stock  X  do  Y  days  from  now"  (for  1<=Y<=100),  then  one  of  those  robots  would  be  perfectly  correct.  The  problem  is  that  an  outside  observer  has  no  way  of  knowing  which  of  the  predictor  robots  is  right.  To  say  that  stock  is  memoryless  strikes  me  as  not  quite  right  --  to      the  extent  that  stocks  are  valued  based  on  earnings,  much  of  what  we      infer  about  future  earnings  relies  on  past  and  present  earnings.  To  put  it  another  way  -  you  have  $1000  now,  and  need  to  decide  whether  to  invest  in  a  particular  stock,  or  a  stock  index.  The  "memoryless"  property  means  that  no  matter  how  many  earning  reports  you  view  ...  by  the  time  you  see  them,  the  stock  price  already  accounts  for  them,  so  they're  not  useful  to  you.  If  the  earning  reports  are  positive,  the  stock  is  already  "too  high"  because  people  bought  it  before  you  did.  So  on  average,  you  can't  use  this  information  to  predict  the  stock's  future  performance,  and  are  better  off  investing  in  an  index  fund  (unless  you  desire  extra  risk  that  doesn't  come  with  more  profitability).
334313	It  means  price  movements  in  the  past  do  not  affect  price  movements  in  the  future.  Think  of  the  situation  of  a  coin,  if  you  flip  it  once,  and  then  you  flip  it  a  second  time,  the  results  are  independent  of  each  other.  If  the  first  time,  you  flipped  a  HEAD,  it  does  not  mean  that  the  coin  will  remember  it,  and  produce  a  TAIL  the  second  time.  This  is  the  meaning  of  "memoryless".  FYI,  stock  markets  are  clearly  not  memoryless.  It  is  just  an  assumption  for  academic  purposes.
367272	One  thing  you  didn't  mention  is  whether  the  401(k)  offers  a  match.  If  it  does,  this  is  a  slam-dunk.  The  $303  ($303,  right?)  is  $3636/yr  that  will  be  doubled  on  deposit.  It's  typical  for  the  first  5%  of  one's  salary  to  capture  the  match,  so  this  is  right  there.    In  15  years,  you'll  still  owe  $76,519.  But  15  *  $7272  is  $109,080  in  your  401(k)  even  without  taking  any  growth  into  account.  The  likely  value  of  that  401(k)  is  closer  to  $210K,  using  8%  over  that  15  years,  (At  6%,  it  drops  to  'only'  $176K,  but  as  I  stated,  the  value  of  the  match  is  so  great  that  I'd  jump  right  on  that.)  If  you  don't  get  a  match  of  any  kind,  I  need  to  edit  /  completely  rip  my  answer.  It  morphs  into  whether  you  feel  that  15  years  (Really  30)  the  market  will  exceed  the  4%  cost  of  that  money.  Odds  are,  it  will.  The  worst  15  year  period  this  past  century  2000-2014  still  had  a  CAGR  of  4.2%.
230948	If  the  best  they  can  do  is  1/8th  of  a  percent  for  a  15  year  term,  you  are  best  served  by  taking  the  30  year  term.  Pay  it  down  sooner  if  you  can,  but  it's  nice  to  have  the  flexibility  if  you  have  a  month  where  things  are  tight.
368504	Have  you  looked  at  conventional  financing  rather  than  VA?    VA  loans  are  not  a  great  deal.    Conventional  tends  to  be  the  best,  and  FHA  being  better  than  VA.    While  your  rate  looks  very  competitive,  it  looks  like  there  will  be  a  .5%  fee  for  a  refinance  on  top  of  other  closing  costs.      If  I  have  the  numbers  correct,  you  are  looking  to  finance  about  120K,  and  the  house  is  worth  about  140K.    Given  your  salary  and  equity,  you  should  have  no  problem  getting  a  conventional  loan  assuming  good  enough  credit.      While  the  30  year  is  tempting,  the  thing  I  hate  about  it  is  that  you  will  be  78  when  the  home  is  paid  off.    Are  you  intending  on  working  that  long?    Also  you  are  restarting  the  clock  on  your  mortgage.    Presumably  you  have  paid  on  it  for  a  number  of  years,  and  now  you  will  start  that  long  journey  over.  If  you  were  to  take  the  15  year  how  much  would  go  to  retirement?    You  claim  that  the  $320  in  savings  will  go  toward  retirement  if  you  take  the  30  year,  but  could  you  save  any  if  you  took  the  15  year?  All  in  all  I  would  rate  your  plan  a  B-.    It  is  a  plan  that  will  allow  you  to  retire  with  dignity,  and  is  not  based  on  crazy  assumptions.    Your  success  comes  in  the  execution.    Will  you  actually  put  the  $320  into  retirement,  or  will  the  needs  of  the  kids  come  before  that?    A  strict  budget  is  really  a  key  component  with  a  stay  at  home  spouse.  The  A+  plan  would  be  to  get  the  15  year,  and  put  about  $650  toward  retirement  each  month.    Its  tough  to  do,  but  what  sacrifices  can  you  make  to  get  there?    Can  you  move  your  plan  a  bit  closer  to  the  ideal  plan?  One  thing  you  have  not  addressed  is  how  you  will  handle  college  for  the  kids.    While  in  the  process  of  long  term  planning,  you  might  want  to  get  on  the  same  page  with  your  wife  on  what  you  will  offer  the  kids  for  help  with  college.    A  viable  plan  is  to  pay  their  room  and  board,  have  them  work,  and  for  them  to  pay  their  own  tuition  to  community  college.    They  are  responsible  for  their  own  spending  money  and  transportation.      Thank  you  for  your  service.
303177	So  I  will  attempt  to  answer  the  other  half  of  the  question  since  people  have  given  good  feedback  on  the  mortgage  costs  of  your  various  options.  Assumptions:      It  is  certain  that  I  am  off  on  some  (or  all)  of  these  assumptions,  but  they  are  still  useful  for  drawing  a  comparison.      If  you  were  to  make  your  mortgage  payment,  then  contribute  whatever  you  have  left  over  to  savings,  this  is  where  you  would  be  at  the  end  of  30  years.  Wait,  so  the  30  year  mortgage  has  me  contributing  $40k  less  to  savings  over  the  life  of  the  loan,  but  comes  out  with  a  $20k  higher  balance?    Yes,  because  of  the  way  compounding  interest  works  getting  more  money  in  there  faster  plays  in  your  favor,  but  only  as  long  as  your  savings  venue  is  earning  at  a  higher  rate  than  the  cost  of  the  debt  your  are  contrasting  it  with.  If  we  were  to  drop  the  yield  on  your  savings  to  3%,  then  the  30yr  would  net  you  $264593,  while  the  15yr  ends  up  with  $283309  in  the  bank.    Similarly,  if  we  were  to  increase  the  savings  yield  to  10%  (not  unheard  of  for  a  strong  mutual  fund),  the  30yr  nets  $993418,  while  the  15yr  comes  out  at  $684448.    Yes  in  all  cases,  you  pay  more  to  the  bank  on  a  30yr  mortgage,  but  as  long  as  you  have  a  decent  investment  portfolio,  and  are  making  the  associated  contributions,  your  end  savings  come  out  ahead  over  the  time  period.    Which  sounds  like  it  is  the  more  important  item  in  your  overall  picture.  However,  just  to  reiterate,  the  key  to  making  this  work  is  that  you  have  an  investment  portfolio  that  out  performs  the  interest  on  the  loan.    Rule  of  thumb  is  if  the  debt  is  costing  you  more  than  the  investment  will  reliably  earn,  pay  the  debt  off  first.    In  reality,  you  need  your  investments  to  out  perform  the  interest  on  your  debt  +  inflation  to  stay  ahead  overall.    Personally,  I  would  be  looking  for  at  least  an  8%  annual  return  on  your  investments,  and  go  with  the  30  year  option.  DISCLAIMER:  All  investments  involve  risk  and  there  is  no  guarantee  of  making  any  given  earnings  target.
253803	I'd  open  the  Roth  IRA  account  and  fund  for  2015  and  2016.  For  the  very  long  term,  I'd  learn  about  index  funds,  specifically  a  low  cost  S&P  mutual  fund  or  ETF.
350082	I  know  of  no  way  to  answer  your  question  without  'spamming'  a  particular  investment.    First  off,  if  you  are  a  USA  citizen,  max  out  your  401-K.  Whatever  your  employer  matches  will  be  an  immediate  boost  to  your  investment.    Secondly,  you  want  your  our  gains  to  be  tax  deferred.  A  401-K  is  tax  deferred  as  well  as  a  traditional  IRA.    Thirdly,  you  probably  want  the  safety  of  diversification.  You  achieve  this  by  buying  an  ETF  (or  mutual  fund)  that  then  buys  individual  stocks.    Now  for  the  recommendation  that  may  be  called  spamming  by  others  :  As  REITs  pass  the  tax  liability  on  to  you,  and  as  an  IRA  is  tax  deferred,  you  can  get  stellar  returns  by  buying  a  mREIT  ETF.    To  get  you  started  here  are  five:  mREITs    Lastly,  avoid  commissions  by  having  your  dividends  automatically  reinvested  by  using  that  feature  at  Scottrade.  You  will  have  to  pay  commissions  on  new  purchases  but  your  purchases  from  your  dividend  Reinvestment  will  be  commission  free.    Edit:  Taking  my  own  advice  I  just  entered  orders  to  liquidate  some  positions  so  I  would  have  the  $  on  hand  to  buy  into  MORL  and  get  some  of  that  sweet  29%  dividend  return.
160170	What  explains  the  most  of  the  future  returns  of  a  portfolio  is  the  allocation  between  asset  classes.  In  the  long  term,  stock  investments  are  almost  certain  to  return  more  than  any  other  kinds  of  investments.  For  40+  years,  I  would  choose  a  portfolio  of  100%  stocks.  How  to  construct  the  portfolio,  then?  Diversification  is  the  key.  You  should  diversify  in  time  (don't  put  a  large  sum  of  money  into  your  stock  portfolio  immediately;  if  you  have  a  large  sum  to  invest,  spread  it  around  several  years).  You  should  diversify  based  on  company  size  (invest  in  both  large  and  small  companies).  You  should  also  diversify  internationally  (don't  invest  in  just  US  companies).  If  you  prefer  to  pick  individual  stocks,  20  very  carefully  selected  stocks  may  provide  enough  diversification  if  you  keep  diversification  in  mind  during  stock  picking.  However,  careful  stock  picking  cannot  be  expected  to  yield  excess  returns,  and  if  you  pick  stocks  manually,  you  need  to  rebalance  your  portfolio  occasionally.  Thus,  if  you're  lazy,  I  would  recommend  a  mutual  fund,  or  many  mutual  funds  if  you  have  difficulty  finding  a  low-cost  one  that  is  internationally  diversified.  The  most  important  consideration  is  the  cost.  You  cannot  expect  careful  fund  selection  to  yield  excess  returns  before  expenses.  However,  the  expenses  are  certain  costs,  so  prefer  low-cost  funds.  Almost  always  this  means  picking  index  funds.  Avoid  funds  that  have  a  small  number  of  stocks,  because  they  typically  invest  only  in  the  largest  companies,  which  means  you  fail  to  get  diversification  in  company  size.  So,  instead  of  Euro  STOXX  50,  select  STOXX  600  when  investing  to  the  European  market.  ETFs  may  have  lower  costs  than  traditional  mutual  funds,  so  keep  ETFs  in  mind  when  selecting  the  mutual  funds  in  which  to  invest.  For  international  diversification,  do  not  forget  emerging  markets.  It  is  not  excessive  to  invest  e.g.  20%  to  emerging  markets.  Emerging  markets  have  a  higher  risk  but  they  also  have  a  higher  return.  A  portfolio  that  does  not  include  emerging  markets  is  not  in  my  opinion  well  diversified.  When  getting  close  to  retirement  age,  I  would  consider  increasing  the  percentage  of  bonds  in  the  portfolio.  This  should  be  done  primarily  by  putting  additional  money  to  bonds  instead  of  selling  existing  investments  to  avoid  additional  taxes  (not  sure  if  this  applies  to  other  taxation  systems  than  the  Finnish  one).  Bond  investments  are  best  made  though  low-cost  mutual  funds  as  well.  Keep  bond  investments  in  your  local  currency  and  risk-free  assets  (i.e.  select  US  government  bonds).  Whatever  you  do,  remember  that  historical  return  is  no  guarantee  of  future  return.  Actually,  the  opposite  may  be  true:  there  is  a  mean  reversion  law.  If  a  particular  investment  has  returned  well  in  the  past,  it  often  means  its  price  has  gone  up,  making  it  more  likely  that  the  price  goes  down  in  the  future.  So  don't  select  a  fund  based  on  its  historical  return;  instead,  select  a  fund  based  on  low  costs.  However,  I'm  99%  certain  that  over  a  period  of  40  years,  stocks  will  return  better  than  other  investments.  In  addition  to  fund  costs,  taxes  are  the  other  certain  thing  that  will  be  deducted  from  your  returns.  Research  what  options  you  have  to  reduce  the  taxes  you  need  to  pay.  401-K  was  explained  in  another  answer;  this  may  be  a  good  option.  Some  things  recommended  in  other  answers  that  I  would  avoid:
171189	Say  you  have  $15,000  of  capital  to  invest.  You  want  to  put  the  majority  of  your  capital  into  low  risk  investments  that  will  yield  positive  gains  over  the  course  of  your  working  career.    $5,000:  Government  bonds  and  mutual  funds,  split  how  you  want.    $9,500:  Low  risk,  trusted  companies  with  positive  historical  growth.  If  the  stock  market  is  very  unfamiliar  for  you,  I  recommend  Google  Finance,  Yahoo  Finance,  and  Zack's  to  learn  about  smart  investments  you  can  make.  You  can  also  research  the  investments  that  hedge  fund  managers  and  top  investors  are  making.  Google  "Warren  Buffett  or  Carl  Icahn  portfolio",  and  this  will  give  you  an  idea  of  stocks  you  can  put  your  money  into.  Do  not  leave  your  money  into  a  certain  company  for  more  than  25  years.  Rebalance  your  portfolio  and  take  the  gains  when  you  feel  you  need  them.  You  have  no  idea  when  to  take  your  profits  now,  but  5  years  from  now,  you  will  be  a  smart  and  experienced  investor.  A  safe  investment  strategy  to  start  is  to  put  your  money  into  an  ETF  that  mimics  the  S&P  500.  Over  the  past  20  years,  the  S&P  500  has  yielded  gains  of  about  270%.  During  the  financial  crisis  a  few  years  back,  the  S&P  500  had  lost  over  50%  of  its  value  when  it  reached  its  low  point.  However,  from  when  it  hit  rock  bottom  in  2009,  it  has  had  as  high  percentage  gains  in  six  years  as  it  did  in  12  years  from  1995  to  2007,  which  about  200%.  The  market  is  very  strong  and  will  treat  your  money  well  if  you  invest  wisely.  $500:  Medium  -  High  risk  Speculative  Stocks  There  is  a  reason  this  category  accounts  for  only  approximately  3%  of  your  portfolio.  This  may  take  some  research  on  the  weekend,  but  the  returns  that  may  result  can  be  extraordinary.  Speculative  companies  are  often  innovative,  low  priced  stocks  that  see  high  volatility,  gains  or  losses  of  more  than  10%  over  a  single  month.  The  likelihood  of  your  $500  investment  being  completely  evaporated  is  very  slim,  but  if  you  lose  $300  here,  the  thousands  invested  in  the  S&P  500,  low  risk  stocks,  government  bonds,  and  mutual  funds  will  more  than  recuperate  the  losses.    If  your  pick  is  a  winner,  however,  expect  that  the  $500  investment  could  easily  double,  triple,  or  gain  even  more  in  a  single  year  or  over  the  course  of  just  a  few,  perhaps,  2-4  years  will  see  a  very  large  return.  I  hope  this  advice  helps  and  happy  investing!  Sending  your  money  to  smart  investments  is  the  key  to  financial  security,  freedom,  and  later,  a  comfortable  retirement.  Good  luck,  Matt  McLaughlin
509064	I  recommend  you  two  things:  I  like  these  investments  because  they  are  not  high  risk.  I  hope  this  helps.
307767	I  would  like  to  establish  credit  history  -  have  heard  it's  useful  to      gain  employment  and  makes  it  easy  to  rent  an  apartment?  Higher  credit  scores  will  make  it  easier  with  landlords,  that's  true.  As  to  employment  -  they  do  background  checks,  which  means  that  they  usually  won't  like  bad  things,  but  won't  care  about  the  good  things  or  no  things  (they'll  know  you're  a  foreigner  anyway).  Is  it  safe  to  assume  that  this  implies  I  have  no  history  whatsoever?  Probably,  but  you  can  verify  pulling  through  AnnualCreditReport,  don't  go  around  giving  your  personal  information  everywhere.  Is  taking  out  a  secured  loan  the  only  way  for  me?  No,  but  it's  one  of  the  easiest.  Better  would  be  getting  a  secured  Credit  Card,  not  loan.  For  loan  you'll  have  to  pay  interest,  for  a  credit  card  (assuming  you  pay  off  all  your  purchases  immediately)  you  will  only  pay  the  credit  card  fees  (for  secured  credit  cards  they  charge  ~$20-100  yearly  fees,  so  do  shop  around,  the  prices  vary  a  lot!).  If  you're  using  it  wisely,  after  a  year  it  will  be  converted  to  a  regular  credit  card  and  the  collateral  will  be  returned  to  you  with  interest  (which  is  actually  very  competitive,  last  I  heard  it  was  around  2%,  twice  as  much  as  the  online  savings  accounts).  As  to  a  secured  loan  -  you'll  be  paying  4%  to  CU  for  your  own  money.  Doesn't  make  any  sense  at  all  for  me.  For  credit  cards  you'll  at  least  get  some  value  for  your  money  -  convenience,  additional  fraud  protection,  etc.  The  end  result  will  be  the  same.  Usually  the  credit  starts  to  build  up  after  ~6-12  months  (that's  why  after  a  year  your  secured  CC  will  be  converted  to  a  regular  one).  Make  sure  to  have  the  statement  balance  in  the  range  of  10-30%  of  your  credit  limit,  to  get  the  best  results.  Would  it  make  much  better  sense  to  wait  till  I  get  a  job  (then  I  would      have  a  fixed  monthly  salary  and  can  apply  for  a  regular  CC  directly)  You  can  apply,  but  you'll  probably  be  rejected.  As  I  mentioned  in  another  answer  elsewhere,  the  system  in  the  US  is  such  that  you're  unable  to  get  credit  if  you  don't  already  have  credit.  Which  is  kindof  a  magic  circle,  which  you  can  break  with  the  secured  credit  card  as  the  least  costly  solution.
368247	I  would  like  to  post  a  followup  after  almost  a  quarter.  littleadv's  advice  was  very  good,  and  in  retrospect  exactly  what  I  should  have  done  to  begin  with.  Qualifying  for  a  secured  credit  card  is  no  issue  for  people  with  blank  credit  history,  or  perhaps  for  anyone  without  any  negative  entries  in  their  credit  history.  Perhaps,  cash  secured  loans  are  only  useful  for  those  who  really  have  so  bad  a  credit  history  that  they  do  not  qualify  for  any  other  secured  credit,  but  I  am  not  sure.  Right  now,  I  have  four  cash  secured  credit  cards  and  planning  to  maintain  a  20%  utilization  ratio  across  all  of  them.  Perhaps  I  should  update  this  answer  in  1.5  years!
313255	I  think  you  should  try  to  talk  with  the  credit  union  at  your  campus  first,  they  may  have  offer  you  a  credit  card  even  you  don't  have  any  credit  history.
509739	I  came  to  US  as  an  international  student  several  years  ago,  and  I  have  also  experienced  the  same  situation  like  most  of  the  international  students  in  finding  ways  to  build  credit  history.  Below  I  list  out  some  possible  approaches  you  may  want  to  consider:  I.  Get  a  student  job  at  campus  (recommended)  I  think  the  best  way  is  to  get  a  student  job  in  university,  say  a  teaching  assistant  or  student  helper.  In  this  case,  you  can  be  provided  with  a  social  security  number  and  start  to  build  your  own  credit  history.  II.  Get  credit  card  You  can  also  consider  to  apply  for  a  credit  card.  There  are  indeed  some  financial  institutions  that  can  provide  credit  cards  for  international  students  with  no  or  limited  credit  scores  requirement,  say  Discover  and  Bank  of  America.  However,  it  is  relatively  hard  to  get  approved,  simply  because  hey  may  put  more  restriction  in  other  aspects.  For  example,  you  may  be  required  to  keep  sufficient  bank  balance  above  several  thousand  dollars  during  a  period  of  time,  or  you  should  prove  that  you  have  relatives  with  citizenship  in  US  who  can  provide  your  financial  aid  if  needed.  III.  Apply  for  a  loan  (recommended)  Getting  a  loan  product  is  another  alternative  to  get  out  of  this  difficult  situation,  but  most  of  people  don’t  realize  that.  There  are  some  FinTech  start-ups  in  United  States  that  specifically  focus  on  international  students’  loan  financing.  One  representative  example  is  Westbon  (Westbon  ),  an  online  lending  company  that  specializes  in  providing  car  loan  for  international  students  with  no  SSN  or  credit  history.  I  once  used  their  loan  product  to  finance  a  Honda  Accord,  and  Westbon  reported  my  loan  transaction  records  to  US  credit  bureau  during  my  repayment  process.  Later  when  I  officially  got  my  SSN  number,  I  found  my  credit  history  has  been  automatically  synchronized  and  I  don’t  have  to  start  from  all  over  again.  It  never  be  an  easy  journey  for  international  students  to  build  credit  history  in  United  States.  What  approach  you  should  make  really  depends  on  you  own  situation.  I  hope  the  information  above  can  be  useful  and  good  luck  for  your  credit  journey!
18483	There's  an  excellent  new  service  called  SelfScore  that  offers  US  credit  cards  to  international  students.  They  work  with  students  without  a  credit  history  and  even  without  an  SSN  by  using  other  qualifying  factors  such  as  major,  financial  resources  in  their  home  country,  and  employability  upon  graduation.  Worth  clarifying:  it's  neither  a  secured  credit  card  nor  a  prepaid  card.  It's  a  proper  US  credit  card  with  no  annual  fees  and  a  relatively  low  APR  designed  to  help  students  build  US  credit.  The  spending  limit  is  relatively  small  but  that  probably  doesn't  matter  for  just  building  a  credit  history.
260384	Yes,  you  can  insure  against  the  fall  in  price  of  stock  by  purchasing  a  put  option.    You  pay  for  a  put  and  if  the  price  of  the  share  falls  below  the  "strike  price"  of  the  put,  then  you  can  exercise  the  put.    On  exercise,  the  person  who  sold  you  the  put  contract  agrees  to  buy  the  stock  for  the  strike  price,  even  though  that  strike  price  is  higher  than  the  market  price.    You  can  adjust  the  level  of  insurance  by  buying  put  options  at  higher  or  lower  prices,  or  buying  fewer  put  options  than  shares  you  own  (leaving  some  shares  uninsured).  Alternatively,  you  can  minimize  your  risk  exposure  by  investing  in  an  index  or  other  fund,  which  gives  you  partial  ownership  in  a  large  number  of  shares.    That  means  on  any  given  day,  lots  of  shares  do  worse  and  lots  of  shares  do  better.    You  can  reduce  the  need  for  insurance  by  purchasing  a  lower-risk,  lower-growth  financial  product.
228217	Put  options  are  basically  this.  Buying  a  put  option  gives  you  the  right  but  not  the  obligation  to  sell  the  underlying  security  at  a  certain  date  for  a  fixed  price,  no  matter  its  current  market  value  at  that  time.  However,  markets  are  largely  effective,  and  the  price  of  put  options  is  such  that  if  you  bought  them  to  cover  you  the  whole  time,  you  would  on  average  pay  more  than  you'd  gain  from  the  underlying  security.  There  is  no  such  thing  as  a  risk-free  investment.
462921	First  off,  the  jargon  you  are  looking  for  is  a  hedge.  A  hedge  is  "an  investment  position  intended  to  offset  potential  losses/gains  that  may  be  incurred  by  a  companion  investment"  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance))  The  other  answers  which  point  out  that  put  options  are  frequently  used  as  a  hedge  are  correct.  However  there  are  other  hedging  instruments  used  by  financial  professionals  to  mitigate  risk.    For  example,  suppose  you  would  really  prefer  that  Foo  Corporation  not  go  bankrupt  --  perhaps  because  they  own  you  money  (because  you're  a  bondholder)  or  perhaps  because  you  own  them  (because  you're  a  stockholder),  or  maybe  you  have  some  other  reason  for  wanting  Foo  Corp  to  do  well.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  loss  due  to  bankruptcy  of  Foo  Corp  you  can  buy  a  Credit  Default  Swap  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap).  A  CDS  is  essentially  a  bet  that  pays  off  if  Foo  Corp  goes  bankrupt,  just  as  insurance  on  your  house  is  a  bet  that  pays  off  if  your  house  burns  down.      Finally,  don't  ever  forget  that  all  insurance  is  not  just  a  bet  that  the  bad  thing  you're  insuring  against  is  going  to  happen,  it  is  also  a  bet  that  the  insurer  is  going  to  pay  you  if  that  happens.    If  the  insurer  goes  bankrupt  at  the  same  time  as  the  thing  you  are  insuring  goes  bad,  you're  potentially  in  big  trouble.
287846	Not  that  I  am  aware.    If  you  are  trying  to  mitigate  losses  from  stock  purchases,  you  may  want  to  consider  stock  mutual  funds.  This  is  why  single  stocks  can  be  extremely  risky.
179052	Get  everything  in  writing.  That  includes  ownership  %,  money  in,  money  out,  who  is  allowed  to  use  the  place,  how  much  they  need  to  pay  the  other  partners,  who  pays  for  repairs,  whether  to  provide  'friends  and  family'  discounts,  who  is  allowed  to  sell,  what  happens  if  someone  dies,  how  is  the  mortgage  set  up,  what  to  do  if  one  of  you  becomes  delinquent,  etc.  etc.  etc.  Money  and  friends  don't  mix.  And  that's  mostly  because  people  have  different  ideas  in  their  head  about  what  'fair'  means.  Anything  you  don't  have  in  writing,  if  it  comes  up  in  a  disagreement,  could  cause  a  friendship-ending  fight.  Even  if  you  are  able  to  agree  on  every  term  and  condition  under  the  sun,  there's  still  a  problem  -  what  if  5  years  from  now,  someone  decides  that  a  certain  clause  isn't  fair?  Imagine  one  of  you  needs  to  move  into  the  condo  because  your  primary  residence  was  pulled  out  from  under  you.  They  crash  at  the  condo  because  they  have  no  where  else  to  go.  You  try  to  demand  payment,  but  they  lost  their  job.  The  agreement  might  say  "you  must  pay  the  partnership  if  you  use  the  condo  personally,  at  the  standard  monthly  rate  *  #  of  days".  But  what  is  the  penalty  clause  -  is  everything  under  penalty  of  eviction,  and  forced  sale  of  the  condo  and  distribution  of  profits?  Following  through  on  such  a  penalty  means  the  friendship  would  be  over.  You  would  feel  guilty  about  doing  it,  and  also  about  not  doing  it  [at  the  same  time,  your  other  partner  loses  their  job,  and  can't  make  1/3rd  of  the  mortgage  payments  anymore!  They  need  the  rent  or  the  bank  will  foreclose  on  their  house!]  etc  etc  etc  Even  things  like  maintenance  -  are  the  3  of  you  going  to  do  it  yourselves?  Labour  distributed  how?  Will  anyone  get  a  management  fee?  What  about  a  referral  fee  for  a  new  renter?  Once  you've  thought  of  all  possible  circumstances  and  rules,  and  drafted  it  in  writing,  go  talk  to  a  lawyer,  and  maybe  an  accountant.  There  will  be  many  things  you  won't  have  considered  yet,  and  paying  a  few  grand  today  will  save  you  money  and  friends  in  the  future.
531299	I  would  second  the  advice  to  not  do  this.  Real  estate  ownership  is  complex  to  begin  with,  involving  a  constant  stream  of  maintenance,  financing,  and  other  decisions.    It  is  difficult  enough  to  do  for  a  single  individual  or  a  family  as  a  unit  (a  couple),  but  at  least  spouses  are  forced  to  compromise.  Friends  are  not,  and  you  can  end  up  with  long-running  conflicts  and  impasses.  Financial  transactions  of  any  kind  impose  tensions  on  relationships,  and  friendships  are  no  exception.  If  you  want  your  friendship  to  survivie,  do  not  sacrifice  it  to  the  financial  arrangement  which  seems  like  a  good  idea  at  the  moment.  My  advice  would  be  to  steer  clear,  no  matter  how  attractive  on  the  surface  the  deal  might  look.  Focus  on  your  own  individual  finances  and  use  discipline  and  patience  to  save  the  amount  needed  for  acquiring  a  separate  investment  property.  But  it  will  be  100%  yours,  and  will  save  tons  of  headache.  Since  you  are  still  considering  this  deal,  it's  a  great  time  to  politely  change  your  mind  and  walk  away  -  believe  me,  a  few  minutes  of  inconvenience  will  save  you  years  of  frustration.  Good  luck!
141622	You  can't  buy  it  outright.  You  can't  take  the  time  to  save  up.  if  the  remaining  choice  is  between  a  card  that  charges  from  day  one,  and  a  card  with  this  kind  of  grace  period,  the  grace  card  is  the  better  choice.  Plan  wisely,  pay  it  in  full  before  that  rate  starts  to  be  charged.  One  additional  note  -  There  are  two  groups  of  people,  the  pay-in-fullers  and  the  balance  carriers.  I  believe  that  one  should  pay  in  full,  and  never  pay  interest.    A  zero  rate  offer  can  be  used  by  the  balance  carrier  to  feel  great  for  12  months,  but  have  even  more  debt  after  the  rate  kicks  in.    As  a  pay-in-full  user,  I've  used  the  zero  rate  to  throw  $20K  at  the  5.25%  mortgage,  and  planned  a  refinance  to  3.5%  just  as  it  ended.  a  $750  savings  (after  the  tax  effect)  well  worth  the  bit  of  effort.    The  fees  should  be  in  the  fine  print.  My  zero  rate  had  a  transfer  fee,  $50  max,  which  was  nothing  in  comparison  to  the  savings.
247343	It  has  been  reported  in  consumer  media  (for  example  Clark  Howard's  radio  program)  that  the  "no  interest  for  12  months"  contracts  could  trick  you  with  the  terms  and  the  dates  on  the  contract.  Just  as  an  example:  You  borrow  $1000  on  12/1/2013,  same  as  cash  for  12  months.    The  contract  will  state  the  due  date  very  clearly  as  12/1/2014.    BUT  they  statements  you  get  will  take  payment  on  the  15th  of  each  month.  So  you  will  dutifully  pay  your  statements  as  they  come  in,  but  when  you  pay  the  final  statement  on  12/15/2014,  you  are  actually  14  days  late,  have  violated  the  terms,  and  you  now  owe  all  the  interest  that  accumulated  (and  it  wasn't  a  favorable  rate).  That  doesn't  happen  all  the  time.    Not  all  contracts  are  written  that  way.    But  you  better  read  your  agreement.  Some  companies  use  the  same  as  cash  deal  because  they  want  to  move  product.  Some  do  it  because  they  want  to  trick  you  with  financing.    Bottom  line  is,  you  better  read  the  contract.
125497	I  too  am  a  full-monthly-statement-balance  payer  and  I  received  a  balance  transfer  offer  from  my  credit-card  company.  This  one  was  quite  different  from  many  others  that  I  have  read  about  on  this  forum.  I  could  do  a  balance  transfer  for  any  amount  up  to  $X  from  another  credit  card,  or  use  the  enclosed  "checks"  to  pay    some  other  (non-credit-card)  bills,  and  I  would  not  have  to  pay  any  interest  for  12  months  on  the  amount  thus  borrowed.    But,  There  would  be  a  2%  service  charge  on  the  amount  I  was  borrowing.  This  amount  would  be  billed  on  the  next  monthly  statement,  and  it  would  have  to  be  paid  in  full  by  the  due  date  of  that  month's  payment,  that  is,  within  the  25-day  grace  period  allowed  for  payment  of  monthly  statements.  Else,  interest  would  start  being  charged  on  the  unpaid  part  of  the  service  charge  at  the  usual  humongous  rate  of  H%  per  month.  If  I  had  not  paid  the  previous  month's  balance  in  full,  I  would  be  charged  interest  at  H%  per  month  on  the  service  charge  starting  from  Day  One;  no  free  ride  till  the  due  date  of  the  next  month's  statement.  Of  course,  the  balance  carried  over  from  last  month  would  also  be  charged  interest  at  H%.  If  I  had  paid  last  month's  bill  in  full,  but  there  were  any  other  charges  (purchases)  during  the  current  month,  then    unless  the  entire  amount  due,  this  month's  purchases  plus  service  charge  and  that  "interest-free-for-twelve-months  loan"    balance  was  paid  off  within  the  25-day  grace  period,  my  purchases  would  be  deemed  unpaid  and  would  start  being  charged  interest.  In  short,  the  only  way  to  avoid  paying  interest  on  the  amount  borrowed  was  to  start  with  a  card  showing  a  $0  balance  due  on  the  previous  month's  statement,  not  make  any  charges  on  that  card  for  a  whole  year,  and  pay  off  that  2%  service  charge  within  the  grace  period.  It  might  also  have  required  that  one-twelfth  of  that  interest-free  loan  be  repaid  each  month,  but    I  had  stopped  reading  the  offer  at  this  point  and  filed  it  in  the  round  circular  file.  In  short,  while  @JoeTaxpayer's  tale  of  how  "As  a  pay-in-full  user,  I've  used  the  zero  rate  to  throw  $20K  at  the  5.25%  mortgage"  is  undoubtedly  how  things  worked  once,  it  is  not  at  all  clear  that  they  still  work  that  way.  At  least,  they  don't  work  that  way  for  me.    Heck,  once  upon  a  time,  for  a  period  of  about  3  months,  you  could  earn  1.5%  interest  per  month  from  the  credit  card  company  by  overpaying  your  credit  card  bill  considerably.  Their  computers  then  just  "added  on"  1.5%  interest  by  multiplying  your  credit  balance  -$X  by  1.015  and  so  you  got  1.5%  per  month  interest  from  the  credit  card  company.  The  credit  card  agreements  (and  the  software!)  got  changed  in  a  hurry,  and  nowdays  all  credit-card  agreements  state  in  the  fine  print  that  if  you  overpay  your  bill,  you  don't  earn  any  interest  on  the  overpayment.
545327	No,  because  of  the  balance  transfer  fees,  which  could  be  4%.  Unless  of  course  you  get  a  deal  for  12  months  of  no  payment,  and  you  pay  it  back  in  12  months,  in  which  case  a  4%  annual  interest  rate  is  much  less  than  a  loan!  At  that  point  you  are  gambling  that  you  will  be  responsible  with  the  payments,  and  the  card  company  is  taking  the  opposite  bet.
264330	If  your  parents  are  not  on  the  deed  then  I  am  not  sure  how  it  could  be  their  house.  It  seems  like  the  sale  was  done  unofficially.  If  your  parents  or  aunt  pass  away  this  could  be  a  real  mess.  Make  this  official  ASAP.  It  might  be  possible  for  your  aunt  to  gift  you  the  house.  This  may  have  tax  implication  but  the  article  below  suggests  that  it  may  not  be  an  issue.  http://www.bankrate.com/finance/real-estate/aunt-be-taxed-for-bargain-price-on-house.aspx  As  you're  probably  aware,  owning  a  house  is  expensive.  Make  sure  you  can  afford  taxes,  bills,  and  maintenance.  Things  add  up  fast.    I  should  have  address  the  "rent  to  own"  plan.  If  you  plan  on  transferring  the  house  from  your  aunt  to  you  by  renting  with  $0  monthly  payment  and  then  claiming  it  is  all  paid  off,  then  I  think  this  would  be  considered  a  gifting  of  the  house  from  your  aunt  to  you.  It  sounds  like  fraud  to  claim  you  paid  something  that  you  didn't.  In  the  end,  it  is  either  a  gift  from  your  parents  or  from  your  aunt.  The  sooner  you  get  the  house  in  your  name  the  better
319915	There's  a  cliche,  "out  of  the  frying  pan  and  into  the  fire".  I've  never  had  the  occasion  to  use  it  till  now.    I  understand  some  people  find  they  have  a  dozen  cards  and  struggle  to  keep  organized.  An  extra  percent  or  two  seems  worth  the  feeling  of  just  one  payment  to  make.  In  your  case,  3  checks  (or  online  payments)  per  month  shouldn't  push  you  to  a  bad  decision.  Twice  the  interest?  No  thanks.  Just  make  the  minimum  payments  on  the  two  lower  rate  cards,  and  pay  all  you  can  to  the  highest  rate.  Do  all  you  can  to  cut  expenses.  The  only  way  out  of  this  is  to  change  your  habits  avoiding  what  got  you  here  in  the  first  place.
48454	does  that  mean  that  30%  of  my  monthly  payment  goes  to  interest?  No,  it's  much  worse  then  that.  The  APR  is  the  annual  percentage  rate.  An  APR  of  30%  on  $23,000  in  debt  that  means  you'll  be  charged  $6,900  in  interest  for  the  year.  You'll  actually  owe  slightly  less  since  you  are  reducing  your  principal  slightly  over  the  course  of  the  year.  If  your  monthly  payment  is  $800,  $575  of  that  will  be  going  to  interest.  That  means  that  over  70%  of  your  monthly  payment  is  going  just  to  interest.  This  deal  makes  no  sense  at  all!  You'd  be  better  off  simply  transferring  all  of  your  balances  on  to  the  credit  card  with  the  highest  interest  rate.  You'd  be  paying  almost  $200  a  month  for  the  'convenience'  of  writing  one  check  rather  than  three.
318191	No,  it  means  that  each  year  (Annual  Payment  Rate)  you  are  accruing  interest  at  29.8%.  If  your  principal  is  $10,000,  that  means  you  are  gaining  $3,000  of  debt  per  year  in  addition  to  this,  excluding  payments  you  make/interest  on  interest.
63088	Your  question  indicates  you  really  don't  have  a  good  grasp  on  personal  finance.    you  might  want  to  read  a  book  or  two.    I'd  recommend  attending  Financial  Peace  University,  but  my  buddy  Joe  Taxpayer  would  throw  an  egg  at  me  for  that.    Please  take  some  sort  of  class.  In  the  mean  time,  here  is  your  plan:    Pay  this  off  do  not  borrow  more.
494306	No.    It  means  each  month  the  total  amount  you  owe  goes  up  by  a  factor  of  (1+0.298/12).    So  if  you  owed  $23K  at  the  beginning  of  the  month,  at  the  end  you  owe  a  total  of  23K*1.0248=$23,571.    Then  subtract  the  $804  you  are  paying.    If  you  want  to  think  of  it  in  terms  of  interest  and  principal,  you  are  paying  $571  a  month  in  interest  and  233  toward  principle,  I  guess.  Paying  off  debt  with  a  lower  interest  rate  using  debt  with  a  higher  interest  rate  is  throwing  a  lot  of  money  away  and  impoverishing  yourself  needlessly.    Psychology  can't  get  around  that.    If  you  want  a  psychological  aid,  decide  how  much  you  are  going  to  pay  toward  these  debts  and  have  it  automatically  deducted  from  your  paycheck  so  you  never  see  it.  Make  the  minimum  payment  on  every  debt  you  have  except  the  one  with  the  highest  interest  rate.    Pay  the  very  most  you  can  toward  that.    Then  when  it  is  paid  off,  move  to  the  next  highest.    Do  all  your  spending  out  of  the  lowest  rate  card,  or  avoid  using  these  credit  cards  until  your  financial  discipline  and  resources  allow  you  to  pay  all  credit  cards  off  completely  at  the  end  of  each  month.
403224	generally  Forward  P/E  is  computed  as  current  price  /  forward  earnings.    The  rationale  behind  this  is  that  buying  the  stock  costs  you  the  current  price,  and  it  gives  you  a  claim  on  the  future  earnings.
593035	P/E  can  use  various  estimates  in  its  calculation  as  one  could  speculate  about  future  P/E  rations  and  thus  could  determine  a  future  valuation  if  one  is  prepared  to  say  that  the  P/E  should  be  X  for  a  company.  Course  it  is  worth  noting  that  if  a  company  isn't  generating  positive  earnings  this  can  be  a  less  than  useful  tool,  e.g.  Amazon  in  the  1990s  lost  money  every  quarter  and  thus  would  have  had  a  N/A  for  a  P/E.  PEG  would  use  P/E  and  earnings  growth  as  a  way  to  see  if  a  stock  is  overvalued  based  on  projected  growth.  If  a  company  has  a  high  P/E  but  has  a  high  earnings  growth  rate  then  that  may  prove  to  be  worth  it.  By  using  the  growth  rate,  one  can  get  a  better  idea  of  the  context  to  that  figure.  Another  way  to  gain  context  on  P/E  would  be  to  look  at  industry  averages  that  would  often  be  found  on  Yahoo!  Finance  and  other  sites.
404605	Your  calculations  are  correct  if  you  use  the  same  mortgage  rate  for  both  the  15  and  30  year  mortgages.    However,  generally  when  you  apply  for  a  15  year  mortgage  the  interest  rate  is  significantly  less  than  the  30  year  rate.    The  rate  is  lower  for  a  number  of  reasons  but  mainly  there  is  less  risk  for  the  bank  on  a  15  year  payoff  plan.
273501	Why  would  anyone  ever  get  a  15  year  instead  of  just  paying  off  a  30  year  in  15  years?  Because  the  rate  is  not  the  same.  Never  that  I've  seen  in  my  30  years  of  following  rates.  I've  seen  the  rate  difference  range  from  .25%  to  .75%.  (In  March  '15,  the  average  rate  in  my  area  is  30yr  3.75%  /  15yr  3.00%)  For  a  $150K  loan,  this  puts  the  15yr  payment  at  $1036,  with  the  30  (at  higher  rate)  paid  in  15  years  at  $1091.  This  $55  difference  can  be  considered  a  flexibility  premium,"  as  it  offers  the  option  to  pay  the  actual  $695  in  any  period  the  money  is  needed  elsewhere.    If  the  rate  were  the  same,  I'd  grab  the  30,  and  since  I  can't  say  "invest  the  difference,"  I'd  say  to  pay  at  a  pace  to  go  15,  unless  you  had  a  cash  flow  situation.  A  spouse  out  of  work.  An  emergency  that  you  funded  with  a  high  interest  rate  loan,  etc.  The  advice  to  have  an  emergency  fund  is  great  until  for  whatever  reason,  there's  just  not  enough.    On  a  personal  note,  I  did  go  with  the  15  year  mortgage  for  our  last  refinance.  I  was  nearing  50  at  the  time,  and  it  seemed  prudent  to  aim  for  a  mortgage  free  retirement.
390642	If  the  interest  rate  in  both  mortgages  is  the  same,  then  yes,  you  will  end  up  paying  the  same  amount  in  interest  if  both  are  paid  off  in  15  years.  However,  in  practice,  almost  always  a  15-year  mortgage  will  have  a  much  lower  interest  rate  that  a  30-year  mortgage.  Also,  if  you  are  thinking  of  taking  out  a  30-year  mortgage  with  the  intention  of  paying  it  off  early,  make  sure  it  does  not  have  an  early  payment  penalty;  this  is  a  penalty  the  bank  will  charge  you  if  you  pay  back  the  loan  early.
359862	Yes.    It  does  cost  the  same  to  pay  off  a  "15  year  in  15"  year  versus  a  "30  year  in  15  year"  mortgage.    After  all,  the  30  year  amortization  period  is  only  used  by  the  lender  to  calculate  the  monthly  payment  he'll  expect,  while,  unbeknownst  to  him,  you  are  using  a  15  year  amortization  and  the  same  rate  to  calculate  the  payments  you'll  really  make.  One  factor:    Can  you  make  extra  payments  at  the  level  you  want,  without  incurring  penalties  from  the  lender?    Most  mortgages  have  prepayment  limits.    After  all.  he's  seeing  his  nice  steady  30  years  of  cash  flow  suddenly  shortened.    He  has  to  go  out  and  find  someone  else  to  lend  the  unexpected  payments  to...  EDIT:    Closed  mortgages,  with  pre-payment  charges  are  the  norm  here  in  Canada;    open  mortgages  predominate  in  the  US    http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/nero/jufa/jufa_018.cfm
516848	All  of  the  answers  given  so  far  are  correct,  but  rather  narrow.  When  you  buy  a  30-year-mortgage,  you  are  buying  the  right  to  pay  off  the  debt  in  as  long  as  30  years.    What  you  pay  depends  on  the  interest  rate  and  how  long  you  actually  take  to  pay  it  off  (and  principal  and  points  and  so  on).  Just  as  you  are  buying  that  right,  the  mortgager  is  selling  you  that  right,  and  they  usually  charge  something  for  it,  typically  a  higher  rate.    After  all,  they,  and  not  you,  will  be  exposed  to  interest  risk  for  30  years.  However,  if  some  bank  has  an  aneurism  and  is  willing  to  give  you  a  30-year  loan  for  the  same  price  as  or  lower  than  any  other  bank  is  willing  to  go  for  a  15-year  loan,  hey,  free  flexibility.    Might  as  well  take  it.    If  you  want  to  pay  the  loan  off  in  15  year,  or  10  or  20,  you  can  go  ahead  and  do  so.
391819	Besides  the  reason  in  @rhaskett's  answer,  it  is  important  to  consider  that  paying  off  a  30-year  mortgage  as  if  it  was  a  15-year  is  much  more  inconvenient  than  just  paying  the  regular  payments  of  a  15-year  mortgage.    When  you  pay  extra  on  your  mortgage,  some  lenders  do  not  know  what  to  do  with  the  extra  payment,  and  need  to  be  told  explicitly  that  the  extra  needs  to  be  applied  toward  the  principal.    You  might  need  to  do  this  every  month  with  every  payment.    In  addition,  some  lenders  won't  allow  you  to  set  up  an  automatic  payment  for  more  than  the  mortgage  payment,  so  you  might  need  to  explicitly  submit  your  payment  with  instructions  for  the  lender  each  month,  and  then  follow  up  each  month  to  make  sure  that  your  payment  was  credited  properly.    Some  lenders  are  better  about  this  type  of  thing  than  others,  and  you  won't  really  know  how  much  of  a  hassle  it  will  be  with  your  lender  until  you  start  making  payments.  If  you  intend  to  pay  it  off  in  15  years,  then  just  get  the  15-year  mortgage.
34389	Consider  the  "opportunity  cost"  of  the  extra  repayment  on  a  15  year  loan.    If  you  owe  money  at  30%  p.a.  and  money  at  4%  p.a.  then  it  is  a  no  brainer  that  the  30%  loan  gets  paid  down  first.  Consider  too  that  if  the  mortgage  is  not  tax  deductable  and  you  pay  income  tax,  that  you  do  not  pay  tax  on  money  you  "save".  (i.e.  in  the  extreme  $1  saved  is  $2  earned).  Forward  thinking  is  key,  if  you  are  paying  for  someone's  college  now,  then  you  would  want  to  pay  out  of  an  education  plan  for  which  contributions  are  tax  deductable,  money  in,  money  out.  In  my  country  most  mortgages,  be  they  15,25,30  years  tend  to  last  6-8  years  for  the  lender.  People  move  or  flip  or  re-finance.    I  would  take  the  15  for  the  interest  rate  but  only  if  I  could  sustain  the  payments  without  hardship.  Maybe  a  more  modest  home  ?      If  you  cannot  afford  the  higher  repayments  you  are  probably  sailing  a  bit  close  to  the  wind  anyway.      Another  thing  to  consider  is  that  tax  benefits  can  be  altered  with  the  stroke  of  a  pen,  but  you  may  still  have  to  meet  repayments.
233472	Other  people  have  belabored  the  point  that  you  will  get  a  better  rate  on  a  15  year  mortgage,  typically  around  1.25  %  lower.  The  lower  rate  makes  the  15  year  mortgage  financially  wiser  than  paying  a  30  year  mortgage  off  in  15  years.    So  go  with  the  15  year  if  your  income  is  stable,  you  will  never  lose  your  job,  your  appliances  never  break,  your  vehicles  never  need  major  repairs,  the  pipes  in  your  house  never  burst,  you  and  your  spouse  never  get  sick,  and  you  have  no  kids.  Or  if  you  do  have  kids,  they  happen  to  have  good  eyesight,  straight  teeth,  they  have  no  aspirations  for  college,  don't  play  any  expensive  sports,  and  they  will  never  ask  for  help  paying  the  rent  when  they  get  older  and  move  out.    But  if  any  of  those  things  are  likely  possibilities,  the  30  year  mortgage  would  give  you  some  flexibility  to  cover  short  term  cash  shortages  by  reverting  to  your  normal  30  year  payment  for  a  month  or  two.  Now,  the  financially  wise  may  balk  at  this  because  you  are  supposed  to  have  enough  cash  in  reserves  to  cover  stuff  like  this,  and  that  is  good  advice.  But  how  many  people  struggle  to  maintain  those  reserves  when  they  buy  a  new  house?    Consider  putting  together  spreadsheet  and  calculating  the  interest  cost  difference  between  the  two  strategies.  How  much  more  will  the  30  year  mortgage  cost  you  in  interest  if  you  pay  it  off  in  15  years?  That  amount  equates  to  the  cost  of  an  insurance  policy  for  dealing  with  an  occasional  cash  shortage.  Do  you  want  to  pay  thousands  in  extra  interest  for  that  insurance?  (it  is  pretty  pricey  insurance)  One  strategy  would  be  to  go  with  the  30  year  now,  make  the  extra  principal  payments  to  keep  you  on  a  15  year  schedule,  see  how  life  goes,  and  refinance  to  a  15  year  mortgage  after  a  couple  years  if  everything  goes  well  and  your  cash  reserves  are  strong.  Unfortunately,  rates  are  likely  to  rise  over  the  next  couple  years,  which  makes  this  strategy  less  attractive.  If  at  all  possible,  go  with  the  15  year  so  you  lock  in  these  near  historic  low  rates.  Consider  buying  less  house  or  dropping  back  to  the  30  year  if  you  are  worried  that  your  cash  reserves  won't  be  able  to  handle  life's  little  surprises.
519346	I  just  wanted  to  point  out  that  the  most  "leverage"  for  pre-paying  occurs  at  the  very  beginning  of  the  mortgage,  and  declines  rapidly  after  that.  So,  your  very  best  scenario  is  to  get  the  30-year,  and  make  one  extra  payment  entirely  to  principal  the  first  month  of  every  year.  This  causes  the  amortization  to  drop  by  96  payments,  to  about  22  years.  I  don't  know  of  any  other  way  that  you  can  get  nearly  4  times  value  for  your  money  (22  payments  extra  to  save  96  payments  later).  After  that,  reducing  from  22  to  15  years  takes  more  of  your  money  for  the  same  result,  but  do  it  if  you  want.  I  actually  did  this,  and  it  put  me  way  ahead  when  I  sold  the  house  about  12  years  later.
593434	Actually  the  extra  payment  comes  off  the  back  end  of  the  mortgage.  So  technically  the  mortgage  is  ony  reduced  one  month.    However,  banks  always  recalculate  the  amortization  table  when  the  last  payment  is  paid  or  a  payoff  amount  is  requested.  There  is  a  difference  between  the  two  situations  but  that  is  a  minor  amount.  The  30  year  note  offers  flexibility  that  the  15  does  not.  Pick  one,  save  money-15  year,  get  flexibility-30  year.
154181	Why  won't  anyone  just  answer  the  original  question?  The  question  was  not  about  opportunity  cost  or  flexibility  or  family  expenses.  There  are  no  right  answers  to  any  of  those  things  and  they  all  depend  on  individual  circumstances.  I  believe  the  answer  to  the  question  of  whether  paying  off  a  30-year  mortgage  in  15  years  would  cost  the  same  amount  as  a  15-year  mortgage  of  the  same  interest  rate  is  yes  but  ONLY  if  you  pay  it  off  on  the  exact  same  schedule  as  your  supposed  15-year.  In  reality,  the  answer  is  NO  for  two  reasons:  the  amortization  schedule;  and  the  fact  that  the  30-year  will  always  have  a  higher  interest  rate  than  the  15-year.  The  way  mortgages  are  amortized,  the  interest  is  paid  first,  essentially.  For  most  people  the  majority  of  the  monthly  payment  is  interest  for  the  first  half  of  the  loan's  life.  This  is  good  for  most  people  because,  in  reality,  most  mortgages  only  last  a  couple  years  after  which  people  refinance  or  move  and  for  those  first  couple  years  the  majority  of  one's  housing  costs  (interest)  are  tax  deductible.  It  is  arguable  whether  perpetuating  this  for  one's  entire  life  is  wise...  but  that's  the  reality  of  most  mortgages.  So,  unless  you  pay  off  your  30-year  on  the  exact  same  amortization  schedule  of  your  theoretical  15-year,  you  will  pay  more  in  interest.  A  common  strategy  people  pursue  is  paying  an  extra  monthly  payment  (or  more)  each  year.  By  the  time  you  get  around  to  chipping  away  at  your  principal  in  that  way,  you  will  already  have  paid  a  lot  more  interest  than  you  would  have  on  a  15-year.  And,  really,  if  you  can  afford  to  substantially  pay  down  principal  in  the  first  year  or  two  of  your  mortgage,  you  probably  should've  borrowed  less  money  to  begin  with.  In  theory,  IF  the  rates  were  the  same  (they're  not)  and  IF  you  paid  the  30  off  every  month  in  the  EXACT  same  way  as  you  would've  paid  a  15  (you  won't)  you  will  pay  the  same  amount  in  the  end.  You  have  to  decide  if  the  flexibility  is  worth  more  to  you  than  the  cost  savings.    For  example:  a  300k  mortgage  at  3.5%  will  have  a  monthly  payment  of  ~$2150  for  a  15-year  and  ~$1350  for  a  30-year,  both  will  start  with  ~$875/month  of  that  being  in  interest  (gradually  declining  with  time).  What  I  think  most  people  undervalue  is  the  freedom  and  peace  of  mind  that  comes  with  a  paid  off  or  nearly  paid  off  home...  and  15  years  is  a  lot  more  tangible  than  30,  plus  a  lot  cheaper  over  all.  If  you  can  afford  a  15-year  mortgage  without  putting  too  much  stress  on  your  budget,  it  is  definitely  the  better  option  for  financial  security.    And  be  careful  of  the  index  fund  opportunity  cost  advice.  On  average  it  may  be  a  good  idea  when  you  look  at  the  very  long  run,  historically,  but  a  lot  of  people  get  less  than  average  returns  depending  on  when  they  buy  and  what  the  market  does  in  the  short  run.  There  is  no  certainty  around  what  returns  you  will  get  from  the  stock  market,  but  if  you  have  a  30-year  mortgage  there  is  a  lot  of  certainty  around  what  you  will  owe  every  month  for  the  next  30-years.  Different  mixes  of  investments  make  sense  for  different  people,  and  most  people  would  be  wise  to  get  some  exposure  to  the  stock  market  for  its  returns  and  liquidity.  However,  if  someone's  goal  is  borrowing  more  money  for  their  house  in  order  to  invest  more  money  in  the  stock  market  for  their  retirement,  they  would  actually  be  better  served  in  achieving  security  and  independence  15  years  sooner.
111091	Unfortunately,  there  is  very  little  data  supporting  fundamental  analysis  or  technical  analysis  as  appropriate  tools  to  "time"  the  market.  I  will  be  so  bold  to  say  that  technical  analysis  is  meaningless.  On  the  other  hand,  fundamental  analysis  has  some  merits.  For  example,  the  realization  that  CDOs  were  filled  with  toxic  mortgages  can  be  considered  a  product  of  fundamental  analysis  and  hence  provided  traders  with  a  directional  assumption  to  buy  CDSs.  However,  there  is  no  way  to  tell  when  there  is  a  good  or  bad  time  to  buy  or  sell.  The  market  behaves  like  a  random  50/50  motion.  There  are  many  reasons  for  this  and  interestingly,  there  are  many  fundamentally  sound  companies  that  take  large  dips  for  no  reason  at  all.  Depending  on  your  goal,  you  can  either  believe  that  this  volatility  will  smooth  over  long  periods  and  that  the  market  has  generally  positive  drift.  On  the  other  hand,  I  feel  that  the  appropriate  approach  is  to  remain  active.  You  will  be  able  to  mitigate  the  large  downswings  by  simply  staying  small  and  diversifying    -  not  in  the  sense  of  traditional  finance  but  rather  looking  for  uncorrelated  products.  Remember,  volatility  brings  higher  levels  of  correlation.  My  second  suggestion  is  to  look  towards  products  like  options  to  provide  a  method  of  shaping  your  P/L  -  giving  up  upside  by  selling  calls  against  a  long  equity  position  is  a  great  example.  Ground  your  trades  with  fundamental  beliefs  if  need  be,  but  use  your  tools  and  knowledge  to  combat  risks  that  may  create  long  periods  of  drawdown.
425020	I  think  by  definition  there  aren't,  generally  speaking,  any  indicators  (as  in  chart  indicators,  I  assume  you  mean)    for  fundamental  analysis.  Off  the  top  of  my  head  I  can't  think  of  one  chart  indicator  that  I  wouldn't  call  'technical',  even  though  a  couple  could  possibly  go  either  way  and  I'm  sure  someone  will  help  prove  me  wrong.  But  the  point  I  want  to  make  is  that  to  do  fundamental  analysis,  it  is  most  certainly  more  time  consuming.  Depending  on  what  instrument  you're  investing  in,  you  need  to  have  a  micro  perspective  (company  specific  details)  and  a  macro  perspective  (about  the  industry  it's  in).  If  you're  investing  in  sector  ETFs  or  the  like,  you'd  be  more  reliant  on  the  macro  analysis.  If  you're  investing  in  commodities,  you'll  need  to  consider  macro  analysis  in  multiple  countries  who  are  big  producers/consumers  of  the  item.  There's  no  cut  and  dried  way  to  do  it,  however  I  personally  opt  for  a  macro  analysis  of  sector  ETFs  and  then  use  technical  analysis  to  determine  my  entry  and/or  exit.
241308	The  three  places  you  want  to  focus  on  are  the  income  statement,  the  balance  sheet,  and  cash  flow  statement.  The  standard  measure  for  multiple  of  income  is  the  P/E  or  price  earnings  ratio    For  the  balance  sheet,  the  debt  to  equity  or  debt  to  capital  (debt+equity)  ratio.  For  cash  generation,  price  to  cash  flow,  or  price  to  free  cash  flow.  (The  lower  the  better,  all  other  things  being  equal,  for  all  three  ratios.)
81655	Fundamental  Analysis  can  be  used  to  help  you  determine  what  to  buy,  but  they  won't  give  you  an  entry  signal  for  when  to  buy.  Technical  Analysis  can  be  used  to  help  you  determine  when  to  buy,  and  can  give  you  entry  signals  for  when  to  buy.  There  are  many  Technical  Indicator  which  can  be  used  as  an  entry  signal,  from  as  simple  as  the  price  crossing  above  a  moving  average  line  and  then  selling  when  the  price  crosses  back  below  the  moving  average  line,  to  as  complicated  as  using  a  combination  of  indicators  to  all  line  up  for  an  entry  signal  to  be  valid.  You  need  to  find  the  entry  signals  that  would  suit  your  investing  or  trading  and  incorporate  them  as  part  of  your  trading  plan.  If  you  want  to  learn  more  about  entry  signals  you  are  better  off  learning  more  about  Technical  Analysis.
158907	I  wrote  a  brilliant  guest  post  at  Don't  Mess  With  Taxes,  titled  Roth  IRAs  and  Your  Retirement  Income.  (Note  -  this  article  now  reflects  2012  rates.  Just  updated)  Simply  put,  it's  an  ongoing  question  of  whether  your  taxes  will  be  higher  now  than  at  any  point  in  the  future.  If  you  are  in  the  25%  bracket  now,  it  would  take  quite  of  bit  of  money  for  your  withdrawals  to  put  you  in  that  bracket  at  retirement.  In  the  case  of  the  IRA,  you  have  the  opportunity  to  convert  in  any  year  between  now  and  retirement  if  your  rate  that  year  drops  for  whatever  reason.    The  simplest  case  is  if  you  are  now  in  the  25%  bracket.  I  say  go  pre-tax,  and  track,  year  by  year  what  your  withdrawal  would  be  if  you  retired  today.    At  15%,  but  with  a  good  chance  for  promotion  to  the  25%  bracket,  start  with  Roth  flavor  and  then  as  you  hit  25%,  use  a  combination.  This  approach  would  smooth  your  marginal  rate  to  stay  at  15%.    To  give  you  a  start  to  this  puzzle,  in  2012,  a  couple  has  a  $11,900  standard  deduction  along  with  2  exemptions  of  $3800  each.  This  means  the  first  $19,500  in  an  IRA  comes  out  tax  free  at  retirement.  If  you  believe  in  a  4%  withdrawal  rate,  you  need  a  retirement  account  containing  $500K  pretax  to  generate  this  much  money.  This  tick  up  with  inflation,  2  years  ago,  it  was  $18,700  and  $467K  respectively.  This  is  why  those  who  scream  "taxes  will  go  up"  may  be  correct,  but  do  you  really  believe  the  standard  deduction  and  exemptions  will  go  away?    Edit  -  and  as  time  passes,  and  I  learn  more,  new  info  comes  to  my  attention.  The  above  thoughts  not  withstanding,  there's  an  issue  of  taxation  of  Social  Security  benefits.  This  creates  a  The  Phantom  Tax  Rate  Zone  which  I  recently  wrote  about.  A  single  person  with  not  really  too  high  an  income  gets  thrust  into  the  46%  bracket.  Not  a  typo,  46.25%  to  be  exact.
586909	I'm  of  the  opinion  that  it  doesn't  matter  much  unless  something  in  your  life  changes  in  retirement.  And  since  many  retirement  planners  assume  a  default  income  target  of  80  percent  of  pre-retirement  income,  I  figure  many  people's  tax  bracket  isn't  moving  much.  The  most  interesting  reason  I  know  to  Go  Roth  in  a  401k  is  limits.  You  can  only  contribute  like  $17k,  whether  Roth  or  not.  In  a  traditional  contribution,  some  of  the  17k  you  put  in  goes  to  taxes  when  taken  out,  but  in  a  Roth  contribution  you  pay  taxes  up  front.  So  if  you  have  more  than  $17k  to  invest,  Roth  lets  you  sneak  some  more  into  the  system.
47747	The  Finance  Buff  discusses  why  the  Roth  401k  is  often  disadvantaged  compared  to  a  Traditional  401k  in  the  article  The  Case  Against  the  Roth  401k,  including  the  following  reasons  (paraphrased):  Contributions  to  the  401k  come  from  the  "top"  of  your  highest  tax  bracket  rate  but  withdrawals  fill  in  from  the  "bottom".    For  example,  suppose  you  are  in  the  28%  tax  bracket.    Every  marginal  dollar  you  contribute  to  the  Traditional  401k  reduces  your  tax  burden  by  .28  cents.    However,  when  withdrawing,  the  first  $10,150  of  income  is  tax-free  (from  standard  deduction  and  exemption,  2014  numbers;  $20,300  for  married  couples,  joint  filing).    The  next  dollars  are  at  the  10%  tax  bracket,  and  so  on.    This  is  an  advantage  for  the  Traditional  401k  only  if  you  earn  less  when  withdrawing  than  you  did  when  contributing,  a  reasonable  assumption.  Avoid  High  State  Income  Tax.  There  are  many  states  that  have  low  or  no  state  income  tax.    If  you  live  in  a  state  with  a  high  income  tax,  paying  tax  now  through  the  Roth  401k  reduces  the  benefit  of  moving  to  a  state  with  a  lower  income  tax  rate.  Avoid  triggering  credit  phaseouts.  Many  tax  credits  (e.g.  student  loan  interest,  child  tax  credit,  Hope  credit,  Roth  IRA  eligibility,  etc.)  begin  phasing  out  as  your  income  increases.    Contributing  to  the  Traditional  401k  can  help  you  realize  more  of  those  credits  when  you  starting  running  up  against  those  limits.  As  described  in  the  article,  if  these  items  don't  apply,  contributing  to  the  Roth  401k  can  be  a  valuable  component  of  tax  diversification.
256921	In  the  other  question,  the  OP  had  posted  a  screenshot  (circa  2010)  from  Transunion  with  suggestions  on  how  to  improve  the  OP's  credit  score.    One  of  these  suggestions  was  to  obtain  "retail  revolving  accounts."    By  this,  they  are  referring  to  credit  accounts  from  a  particular  retail  store.    Stores  have  been  offering  credit  accounts  for  many  years,  and  today,  this  usually  takes  the  form  of  a  store  credit  card.    The  credit  card  does  not  have  the  Visa  or  MasterCard  logo  on  it,  and  is  only  valid  at  that  particular  store.    (For  example,  Target  has  their  own  credit  card  that  only  works  at  Target  stores.)    The  "revolving"  part  simply  means  that  it  is  an  open  account  that  you  can  continue  to  make  new  charges  and  pay  off,  as  opposed  to  a  fixed  retail  financing  loan  (such  as  you  might  get  at  a  high-end  furniture  store,  where  you  obtain  a  loan  for  a  single  piece  of  furniture,  and  when  it  is  paid  off,  the  account  is  closed).  The  formula  for  credit  scores  are  proprietary  secrets.    However,  I  haven't  read  anything  that  indicates  that  a  store  credit  card  helps  your  credit  score  more  than  a  standard  credit  card.    I  suspect  that  Transunion  was  offering  this  tip  in  an  attempt  to  give  the  consumer  more  ideas  of  how  to  add  credit  cards  to  their  account  that  the  consumer  might  not  have  thought  of.    But  it  is  possible  that  buried  deep  in  the  credit  score  formula,  there  is  something  in  there  that  gives  you  a  higher  score  if  you  have  a  store  credit  card.  As  an  aside,  the  OP  in  the  other  question  had  a  credit  score  of  766  and  was  trying  to  make  it  higher.    In  my  opinion,  this  is  pointless.    Remember  that  the  financial  services  industry  has  an  incentive  to  sell  you  as  much  debt  as  possible,  and  so  all  of  their  advice  will  point  to  you  getting  more  credit  accounts  and  getting  more  in  debt.
451453	A  retail  revolving  account  is  essentially  a  credit  card  offered  by  a  store  (or  chain  of  stores)  and  usable  only  at  that  store.  In  my  area,  the  Sears  department  store's  "Sears  card"  would  be  a  good  example.  Stores  offer  these  to  capture  a  bit  more  profit  from  the  transaction.  They  don't  have  to  pay  someone  else's  processing  fees,  and  they  get  to  keep  any  interest  you  pay.  Of  course  they  also  accept  the  costs  that  go  along  with  retail  lending.  It  operates  just  like  any  other  revolving-credit  card.  Read  the  fine  print  of  the  agreement  to  see  what  the  grace  period  is,  if  any,  and  what  APR  they're  charging  after  that.  These  cards  also  serve  as  a  marketing  tool.  Some  stores  don't  accept  any  other  card.  Some  can  do  "instant  approvals"  to  encourage  you  to  make  a  large  purchase  now  rather  than  continuing  to  shop  around.  Some  may  offer  special  deals  only  if  you  use  their  card  --  I  paid  0%  interest  for  a  year  on  my  refrigerator,  which  was  convenient  for  me.  And  so  on.  Gasoline  stations  also  used  to  offer  their  own  cards...  though  these  days  it's  common  for  them  to  offer  a  branded  version  of  one  of  the  major  credit  cards  instead.
449131	A  retail  revolving  account  is  a  more  formal  name  for  a  general  credit  card.      A  revolving  account  is  an  account  created  by  a  lender  to  represent  debts  where  the  outstanding  balance  does  not  have  to  be  paid  in  full  every  month  by  the  borrower  to  the  lender.  The  borrower  may  be  required  to  make  a  minimum  payment,  based  on  the  balance  amount.  Retail  Revolving  Account  Wikipedia  This  is  different  from  something  like  a  car  loan  or  mortgage  or  other  more  structured  or  secured  debt.      It  used  to  be  somewhat  common  for  very  large  retailers  to  issue  lines  of  credit  to  their  customers  in  the  form  of  a  store  card.    This  card  was  a  lot  like  a  credit  card  but  only  accepted  at  the  specific  retailer.    These  kinds  of  cards  are  all  but  extincted.    Now  major  retailers  will  simply  co-brand  a  credit  card  with  a  major  bank,  the  differentiation  being  preferred  rewards  when  used  at  the  retailer.
105694	To  add  to  what  others  have  said,  INSTALLMENT  CREDIT  is  a  stronger  factor  when  building  credit.  An  installment  credit  is  essentially  a  loan  with  a  fixed  repay  amount  such  as  a  student  loan  and  a  car  loan.  Banks  (when  it  comes  to  buying  your  first  home)  want  to  see  that  you  are  financially  able  to  repay  a  big  debt  (car  loan).  But  be  careful,  if  you  cannot  pay  cash,  you  cannot  afford  it.  My  rule  of  thumb  is  that  when  I'm  charging  something  to  my  CC,  I  MUST  pay  it  off  when  it  posts  to  my  account.  I  just  became  debt  free  (paid  off  about  15k  in  CC  and  student  loan  debt  in  18  months)  and  I  love  it.
298746	You  might  want  to  head  on  over  to  https://law.stackexchange.com/  and  ask  the  same  question.      However  from  a  personal  finance  perspective  this  kind  of  drama  is  somewhat  common  when  someone  is  deceased  and  financial  expectations  are  not  met  by  the  heirs.    It  sounds  like  the  daughter  was  expecting  a  lot  more  in  inheritance  than  was  actually  received.    There  was  probably  an  overestimation  of  dad's  net  worth  and  an  underestimation  of  the  cost  of  his  care  toward  the  end  of  his  life.  Its  best  not  to  participate  in  this  drama,  and  I  feel  that  you  are  correct  that  the  daughter  does  not  have  a  right  to  see  the  bank  account  statements  prior  to  dad's  passage.    The  question  is  also  if  she  has  a  right  to  see  it  now.  Here  in  the  US  a  joint  account  can  be  setup  so  the  ownership  transfers  to  other  account  holder(s)  up  death  of  an  owner.    So  in  this  case  your  mother  would  own  the  account.    If  the  account  is  setup  as  such,  then  the  estate  has  no  right  to  that  money.    You  may  want  to  check  with  the  bank  for  some  free  advice.    What  is  the  classification  of  the  account  now  that  dad  has  passed?    When  a  person  grants  someone  else  the  power  of  attorney  they  have  the  ability  to  act  as  if  they  were  that  person.    Most  of  the  time  POAs  are  limited  in  scope  so  If  I  give  a  person  the  POA  to  register  a  car  in  my  name,  they  cannot  apply  for  a  credit  card  in  my  name  (legally).    In  this  case,  however,  the  POA  was  probably  general  so  pretty  much  your  mom  could  do  whatever  she  pleased.  So  if  your  mom  took  good  care  of  the  dad  and  bought  herself  some  nice  jewelry  that  is  perfectly  allowable  with  a  general  POA.  I  strongly  doubt  this  daughter  has  any  rights  to  the  past  records  and  may  not  even  have  the  rights  to  the  joint  bank  account  currently.
287325	What  could  the  tax  issues  with  the  IRS  be?  I  thought  (but  not  totally  certain)  that  the  tax  treatment  of  an  ISO  option  was  based  on  difference  between  exercise  price  and  FMV  at  the  time  of  the  sale.    This  is  an  accounting  issue.  There  were  times  not  so  long  ago  that  companies  actually  did  these  things  on  purpose,  to  boost  the  stock  grant  values  for  their  employees  (especially  senior  employees).  They  would  give  a  grant  but  date  it  with  an  earlier  date  with  a  more  favorable  valuation.  This  is  called  "backdating",  and  it  brought  companies  down  and  CEOs  into  criminal  courts.  In  addition,  only  reasonable  compensation  is  allowed  as  a  deduction  for  the  company,  and  incorrectly  set  strike  price  may  be  deemed  unreasonable.  Thus,  the  deduction  the  company  would  take  for  your  compensation  can  be  denied,  leading  to  loss  of  tax  benefit  (this  was  also  a  weapon  used  by  the  IRS  at  the  time  against  companies  doing  backdating).  Last  but  not  least,  company  that  has  intentions  of  going  public  cannot  allow  itself  such  a  blatant  disregard  of  the  accounting  rules.  Even  if  the  mistake  was  not  made  on  purpose  (as  it  sounds),  it  is  a  mistake  that  has  to  be  corrected.  What  should  I  take  into  consideration  to  determine  whether  a  27%  increase  in  shares  is  a  fair  exchange  for  an  increase  in  270%  increase  in  strike  price.  Did  you  know  the  strike  price  when  you  signed  the  contract?  Was  it  a  consideration  for  you?  For  most  people,  the  strike  price  is  determined  at  the  board  approval,  since  the  valuations  are  not  public  and  are  not  disclosed  before  you  actually  join,  which  is  already  after  you've  agreed  to  the  terms.  So  basically,  you  agreed  to  get  100  sheets  of  toilet  paper,  and  instead  getting  127  sheets.  So  you're  getting  27  sheets  more  than  you  initially  agreed  to.  Why  are  you  complaining?  In  other  words,  options  are  essentially  random  numbers  which  are  quite  useless.  By  the  time  you  get  to  exercise  them,  they'll  be  diluted  through  a  bunch  of  additional  financing  rounds,  and  their  value  will  be  determined  for  real  only  after  the  IPO,  or  at  least  when  your  company's  stocks  are  trading  OTC  with  some  reasonable  volume.  Until  then  -  it's  just  a  number  with  not  much  of  a  meaning.  The  FMV  does  matter  for  early  exercise  and  83(b)  election,  if  that  is  an  option,  but  even  then  -  I  doubt  you  can  actually  negotiate  anything.
544800	Both  you  and  the  Company  were  probably  benefitted  by  this  decision.    Specifically  an  option  grant  that  was  not  FRV  or  more  would  require  you  to  recognize  the  option  as  income  whether  you  had  exercised  it  or  not.    Additionally  a  host  of  other  409A  tax  issues/penalties  could  have  been  levied  against  you  as  an  employee  recipient.    I  certainly  appreciate  your  concern  about  a  change  in  compensation,  but  this  is  one  where  Corporate  America  likely  saved  your  bacon.
138283	If  one  takes  a  slightly  more  expansive  view  of  the  word  "saving"  to  include  most  forms  of  durable  asset  accumulation,  I  think  the  reason  some  do  and  most  don't  is  a  matter  of  a  few  factors,  I  will  include  the  three  that  seem  obvious  to  me:  Education  Most  schools  in  the  US  where  I  live  do  not  offer  personal  finance  courses,  and  even  when  they  do,  there  is  no  opportunity  for  a  student  to  practice  good  financial  habits  in  that  classroom  setting.  I  think  a  simple  assignment  that  required  students  to  track  every  penny  that  they  spend  over  the  period  of  a  few  months  would  help  them  open  their  eyes  to  how  much  money  is  spent  on  trivial  things  that  they  don't  need.  Perhaps  this  would  be  more  effective  in  a  university  setting  where  the  students  are  usually  away  from  home  and  therefore  more  responsible  for  the  spending  that  occurs  on  their  own  behalf.  Beyond  simple  education  about  personal  finances,  most  people  have  no  clue  how  the  various  financial  markets  work.  If  they  understood,  they  would  not  allow  inflation  to  eat  away  at  their  savings,  but  that's  a  separate  topic  from  why  people  do  not  save.  Culture  Since  much  of  the  education  above  isn't  happening,  children  get  their  primary  financial  education  from  their  parents.  This  means  that  those  who  are  wealthy  teach  their  children  how  to  be  wealthy,  and  those  who  are  poor  pass  on  their  habits  to  children  who  often  also  end  up  poor.  Erroneous  ideas  about  consumption  vs.  investment  and  its  economic  effects  also  causes  some  bad  policy  encouraging  people  to  live  beyond  their  means  and  use  credit  unwisely,  but  if  you  live  in  a  country  where  the  average  person  expects  to  eat  out  regularly  and  trade  in  their  automobiles  as  soon  as  they  experienced  their  highest  rate  of  depreciation,  it  can  be  hard  to  recognize  bad  financial  behavior  for  what  it  is.  Collective  savings  rates  reflect  a  lot  of  individuals  who  are  emulating  each  other's  bad  behavior.  Discipline  Even  when  someone  is  educated  about  finances,  they  may  not  establish  good  habits  of  budgeting  regularly,  tracking  spending,  and  setting  financial  goals.  For  me,  it  helps  to  be  married  to  someone  who  has  similar  financial  goals,  because  we  budget  monthly  and  any  major  purchases  (over  $100  or  so)  must  be  agreed  upon  at  the  beginning  of  the  month  (with  obvious  exceptions  for  emergencies).  This  eliminates  any  impulsive  spending,  which  is  probably  90%  of  the  battle  for  me.  Some  people  do  not  need  to  account  to  someone  else  in  order  to  spend  wisely,  but  everyone  should  find  a  system  that  works  for  them  and  helps  them  to  maintain  some  financial  discipline.
184243	A  person  who  always  saves  and  appropriately  invests  20%  of  their  income  can  expect  to  have  a  secure  retirement.  If  you  start  early  enough,  you  don't  need  anything  close  to  20%.  Now,  there  are  many  good  reasons  to  save  for  things  other  than  just  retirement,  of  course.  You  say  that  you  can  save  80%  of  your  income,  and  you  expect  most  people  could  save  at  least  50%  without  problems.  That's  just  unrealistic  for  most  people.  Taxes,  rent  (or  mortgage  payments),  utilities,  food,  and  other  such  mandatory  expenses  take  far  more  than  50%  of  your  income.  Most  people  simply  don't  have  the  ability  to  save  (or  invest)  50%  of  their  income.  Or  even  25%  of  their  income.
482968	This  question  is  likely  to  be  voted  closed  as  opinion-based.  That  said  -  In  general  people  have  become  accustomed  to  instant  gratification.  They  also  have  the  media  showing  them  luxury  and  are  enticed  every  day  to  buy  things  they  don't  need.    In  the  US,  the  savings  rate  is  awfully  low,  but  it's  not  just  the  lower  50%,  it's  75%  of  people  who  aren't  saving  what  they  should.    see  http://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/working_papers/pfeffer-danziger-schoeni_wealth-levels.pdf  for  an  interesting  article  on  the  topic  of  accumulated  wealth.
473015	First  lets  understand  what  convexity  means:  Convexity  -    convexity  refers  to  non-linearities  in  a  financial  model.  In  other      words,  if  the  price  of  an  underlying  variable  changes,  the  price  of  an      output  does  not  change  linearly,  but  depends  on  the  second  derivative      (or,  loosely  speaking,  higher-order  terms)  of  the  modeling  function.      Geometrically,  the  model  is  no  longer  flat  but  curved,  and  the  degree      of  curvature  is  called  the  convexity.  Okay  so  for  us  idiots  this  means:  if  the  price  of  ABC  (we  will  call  P)  is  determined  by  X  and  Y.  Then  if  X  decreases  by  5  then  the  value  of  P  might  not  necessarily  decrease  by  5  but  instead  is  also  dependent  on  Y  (wtf$%#!  is  Y?,  who  cares,  its  not  important  for  us  to  know,  we  can  understand  what  convexity  is  without  knowing  the  math  behind  it).  So  if  we  chart  this  the  line  would  look  like  a  curve.  (clearly  this  is  an  over  simplification  of  the  math  involved  but  it  gives  us  an  idea)  So  now  in  terms  of  options,  convexity  is  also  known  as  gamma,  it  will  probably  be  easier  to  talk  about  gamma  instead  of  using  a  confusing  word  like  convexity(gamma  is  the  convexity  of  options).  So  lets  define  Gamma:  Gamma  -  The  rate  of  change  for  delta  with  respect  to  the  underlying  asset's  price.  So  the  gamma  of  an  option  indicates  how  the  delta  of  an  option  will  change  relative  to  a  1  point  move  in  the  underlying  asset.  In  other  words,  the  Gamma  shows  the  option  delta's  sensitivity  to  market  price  changes.  or  Gamma  shows  how  volatile  an  option  is  relative  to  movements  in  the  underlying  asset.  So  the  answer  is:  If  we  are  long  gamma  (convexity  of  an  option)  it  simply  means  we  are  betting  on  higher  volatility  in  the  underlying  asset(in  your  case  the  VIX).  Really  that  simple?  Well  kinda,  to  fully  understand  how  this  works  you  really  need  to  understand  the  math  behind  it.  But  yes  being  long  gamma  means  being  long  volatility.  An  example  of  being  "long  gamma"  is  a  "long  straddle"  Side  Note:  I  personally  do  trade  the  VIX  and  it  can  be  very  volatile,  you  can  make  or  lose  lots  of  money  very  quickly  trading  VIX  options.  Some  resources:  What  does  it  mean  to  be  "long  gamma"  in  options  trading?

273598	Long  convexity  is  achieved  by  owning  long  dated  low  delta  options.  When  a  significant  move  occurs  in  the  underlying  the  volatility  curve  will  move  higher.  Instead  of  a  linear  relationship  between  your  long  position  and  it's  return,  you  receive  a  multiple  of  the  linear  return.  For  example:  Share  price  $50  Long  1  (equals  100  shares)  contract  of  a  2  year  100  call  Assume  this  is  a  5  delta  option  If  the  stock  price  rises  to  $70  the  delta  of  the  option  will  rise  because  it  is  now  closer  to  the  strike.  Lets  assume  it  is  now  a  20  delta  option.  Then    Expected  return  on  a  $20  price  move  higher,  100  shares($20)(.20-.05)=$300  However  what  happens  is  the  entire  volatility  surface  rises  and  causes  the  20  delta  option  to  be  30  delta  option.  Then  The  return  on  a  $20  price  move  higher,  100  shares($20)(.30-.05)=$500  This  $200  extra  gain  is  due  to  convexity  and  explains  why  option  traders  are  willing  to  pay  above  the  theoretical  price  for  these  options.
48050	Convexity  refers  to  vega.  Gamma  refers  to  delta.  Negative  carry  refers  to  time  decay.
224667	Sure;  you  can  deposit  cash.  A  few  notes  apply:  Does  the  source  of  cash  need  to  be  declared  ?  If  you  deposit  more  than  $10,000  in  cash  or  other  negotiable  instruments,  you'll  be  asked  to  complete  a  form  called  a  Currency  Transaction  Report  (here's  the  US  Government's  guidance  for  consumers  about  this  form).  There's  some  very  important  information  in  that  guidance  document  about  structuring,  which  is  a  fairly  serious  crime  that  you  can  commit  if  you  break  up  your  deposits  to  avoid  reporting.  Don't  do  this.  The  linked  document  gives  examples.  Also  don't  refuse  to  make  your  deposit  and  walk  away  when  presented  with  a  CTR  form.    In  addition,  you  are  also  required  to  report  to  Customs  and  Border  Protection  when  you  bring  more  than  $10,000  in  or  out  of  the  country.  If  you  are  caught  not  doing  so,  the  money  may  be  seized  and  you  could  be  prosecuted  criminally.  Many  countries  have  similar  requirements,  often  with  different  dollar  amounts,  so  it's  important  to  make  sure  you  comply  with  their  laws  as  well.  The  information  from  this  reporting  goes  to  the  government  and  is  used  to  enforce  finance  and  tax  laws,  but  there's  nothing  wrong  or  illegal  about  depositing  cash  as  long  as  you  don't  evade  the  reporting  requirements.  You  will  not  need  to  declare  precisely  where  the  cash  comes  from,  but  they  will  want  the  information  required  on  the  forms.    Is  it  taxable  ?  Simply  depositing  cash  into  your  bank  account  is  not  taxable.  Receiving  some  forms  of  income,  whether  as  cash  or  a  bank  deposit,  is  taxable.  If  you  seem  to  have  a  large  amount  of  unexplained  cash  income,  it  is  possible  an  IRS  audit  will  want  an  explanation  from  you  as  to  where  it  comes  from  and  why  it  isn't  taxable.    In  short,  if  the  income  was  taxable,  you  should  have  paid  taxes  on  it  whether  or  not  you  deposit  it  in  a  bank  account.  What  is  the  limit  of  the  deposit  ?  There  is  no  government  limit.  An  individual  bank  may  have  their  own  limit  and/or  may  charge  a  fee  for  larger  deposits.  You  could  always  call  the  bank  and  ask.
227192	A  huge  amount  of  money  in  all  financial  markets  is  from  institutional  investors,  such  as  mutual  funds,  government  pension  plans,  sovereign  wealth  funds,  etc.    For  various  reasons  these  funds  do  all  of  their  trading  at  the  end  of  the  day.    They  care  primarily  that  their  end-of-day  balances  are  in  line  with  their  targets  and  are  easy  to  audit  and  far  less  about  "timing  the  market"  for  the  best  possible  trades.  So,  if  you're  looking  at  a  stock  that  is  owned  by  many  institutional  investors  --  such  as  a  stock  (like  AAPL)  that  makes  up  a  significant  portion  of  an  index  that  many  funds  track  --  there  will  be  a  huge  amount  of  activity  at  this  time  relative  to  stocks  that  are  less  popular  among  institutions.  Even  just  in  its  introduction  this  paper  (PDF)  gives  a  fair  overview  of  other  reasons  why  there's  a  lot  of  trading  at  end-of-day  in  general.  (In  fact,  because  of  all  this  closing  activity  and  the  reliance  on  end-of-day  prices  as  signposts  for  financial  calculations,  the  end-of-day  has  for  decades  been  the  single  most  fraud-ridden  time  of  the  trading  day.    Electronic  trading  has  done  away  with  a  lot  of  the  straight-up  thievery  that  floor  traders  and  brokers  used  to  get  away  with  at  the  expense  of  the  public,  but  it  still  exists.    See,  for  example,  any  explanation  of  the  term  banging  the  close,  or  the  penalties  against  6  banks  just  last  month  for  manipulating  the  FX  market  at  the  close.)
413899	On  July  20,  when  you  posted  this  question,  AAPL  was  trading  almost  at  115.    The  market  charges  an  extra  premium  for  buying  an  option  that  is  in  the  money  (or  on  the  money  like  this  case)  over  one  that  is  out  of  the  money.    In  order  for  the  130  Call  to  be  worth  something  the  market  has  to  go  up  15  points.  Otherwise  you  lose  100%  of  your  premium.  On  the  other  hand  with  the  115  every  point  that  the  market  goes  up  means  that  you  recover  some  of  that  premium.  It  is  much  more  likely  that  you  recover  part  of  your  premium  with  the  115  than  with  the  130.    With  the  higher  probability  of  losing  part  of  the  premium,  the  sellers  are  going  to  be  reluctant  to  write  the  option  unless  they  receive  larger  compensation.
277359	Think  about  it  this  way.  If  the  strike  price  is  $200,  and  cost  of  the  option  is  $0.05.  $200  +  $0.05  is  $200.05.  That  does  not  mean  that  the  price  of  buying  the  option  is  more.  Neither  is  the  option  writer  going  to  pay  you  $70  to  buy  the  contract.    When  you  are  buying  options,  you  can  only  have  a  limited  downside  and  that  is  the  premium  that  you  pay  for  it.    In  case  of  the  $115  contract,  your  total  loss  could  be  a  maximum  of  $19.3.    In  case  of  the  $130  contract,  your  total  loss  could  be  a  maximum  of  $9.3.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  chances  of  AAPL  going  to  hit  $130  is  less  than  the  chance  of  AAPL  hitting  $115.  Therefore,  option  writers  offer  the  lower  probability  contracts  at  a  lower  price.    Long  story  short,  you  do  not  pay  for  the  Strike  price.  You  only  pay  the  premium  and  that  premium  keeps  getting  lower  with  and  increase  in  Strike  price(Or  decrease  if  it  is  a  put  option).  Strike  price  is  just  a  number  that  you  expect  the  stock  or  index  to  break.  I  would  suggest  you  to  read  up  a  little  more  on  pricing  from  here
469830	Most  brokers  have  a  margin  maintenance  requirement  of  30%.    In  your  example,  it  would  depend  on  how  much  money  you're  borrowing  from  your  broker  on  margin.  Consider  this:  You  have  $250,  and  short  AAPL  at  $500  on  margin.  This  would  be  a  common  scenario  (federal  law  requires  investors  to  have  at  least  50%  of  their  margin  equity  when  opening  a  transaction).  If  your  broker  had  a  requirement  of  30%,  they  would  require  that  for  your  $500  position,  you  have  at  least  $500  *  .3  =  $150  equity.  Since  you  are  currently  above  that  number  at  $250,  you  will  not  be  hit  with  a  margin  call.  Say  the  price  of  AAPL  doubles,  and  now  your  position  is  worth  $1000.  $1000  *  .3  =  $300,  which  is  $50  above  your  initial  equity.  Your  broker  will  now  consider  you  eligible  for  a  margin  call.  Most  will  not  execute  the  call  right  away,  you  will  often  have  some  time  to  either  sell/cover  stock  or  add  funds  to  your  account.  But  not  all  brokers  will  warn  you  if  you  are  breaking  margin  requirements,  and  sometimes  margin  calls  can  take  you  by  surprise  if  you  are  not  paying  attention.  Also,  many  will  charge  interest  on  extra  margin  borrowed.
331606	When  margin  is  calculated  as  the  equity  percentage  of  an  account,  the  point  at  which  a  broker  will  forcibly  liquidate  is  typically  called  "maintenance  margin".  In  the  US,  this  is  25%  for  equities.  To  calculate  the  price  at  which  this  will  occur,  the  initial  and  maintenance  margin  must  be  known.    The  formula  for  a  long  with  margin  is:  and  for  a  short  where  P_m  is  the  maintenance  margin  price,  P_i  is  the  initial  margin  price,  m_i  is  the  initial  margin  rate,  and  m_m  is  the  maintenance  margin  rate.    At  an  initial  margin  of  50%  and  a  maintenance  margin  of  25%,  a  long  equity  may  fall  by  1/3  before  forced  liquidation,  a  short  one  may  rise  by  50%.  This  calculation  can  become  very  complex  with  different  asset  classes  with  differing  maintenance  margins  because  the  margin  debt  is  applied  to  all  securities  collectively.
101852	No.  Investors  purchase  ETFs'  as  they  would  any  other  stock,  own  it  under  the  same  circumstances  as  an  equity  investment,  collecting  distributions  instead  of  dividends  or  interest.  The  ETF  takes  care  of  the  internal  operations  (bond  maturities  and  turnover,  accrued  interest,  payment  dates,  etc.).
151394	Based  on  your  question,  I  am  going  to  assume  your  criterion  are:  Based  on  these,  I  believe  you'd  be  interested  in  a  different  savings  account,  a  CD,  or  money  market  account.  Savings  account  can  get  you  up  to  1.3%  and  money  market  accounts  can  get  up  to  1.5%.    CDs  can  get  you  a  little  more,  but  they're  a  little  trickier.  For  example,  a  5  year  CD  could  get  up  to  2%.  However,  now  you're  money  is  locked  away  for  the  next  few  years,  so  this  is  not  a  good  option  if  this  money  is  your  emergency  fund  or  you  want  to  use  it  soon.  Also,  if  interest  rates  increase  then  your  money  market  and  savings  accounts'  interest  rates  will  increase  but  your  CD's  interest  rate  misses  out.  Conversely,  if  interest  rates  drop,  you're  still  locked  into  a  higher  rate.
312359	There  are  many  considerations  before  deciding  on  the  best  place  for  your  funds:  How  liquid  do  you  need  the  funds  to  be?      If  this  is  for  an  emergency  fund  I  would  keep  at  least  some  in  an  account  that  you  have  instant  access  to,    What  is  your  risk  (volatility)  tolerance?  Would  you  be  OK  with  the  value  dropping  by  as  much  as  30%  in  a  year  knowing  that  over  time  you'll  probably  earn  8-12%  on  it?    If  not,  then  equity  funds  or  other  stock  investments  are  probably  not  the  best  move  for  you.  Do  you  need  the  funds  now  or  are  they  for  long-term  (retirement)  savings?  Are  you  eligible  to  fund  an  IRA?  That  would  defer  your  taxes  until  you  withdraw  the  funds  from  the  account,  but  there  are  age  restrictions  that  you  must  heed  to  avoid  penalties.  Are  CDs  a  good  idea?  They  do  pay  decent  interest,  but  in  return  for  that  you  lock  up  your  funds  for  a  set  period  of  time.    All  that  to  say  that  there  are  many  facets  to  determining  the  best  place  for  your  funds.    If  you  provide  more  specifics  you  can  get  a  more  specific  answer.
567256	I  disagree  with  most  of  the  answers  here  so  far  because  they  are  either  too  risky  or  too  conservative  and  don't  take  taxes  and  retirement  into  consideration.  OP,  keep  in  mind  the  higher  the  potential  return,  the  greater  the  risk.  You  haven't  stated  your  risk  tolerance,  but  consider  the  following:  Pick  a  certain  percentage  of  your  $10k  to  invest  for  the  long  term.  Pick  a  low-cost  index  fund  like  the  S&P500  Index.  Historically  this  investment  does  well  in  the  long  run,  and  it  gets  you  started  in  investing.  Keep  the  balance,  the  money  you  will  need  for  the  short  term,  right  where  it  is  not  earning  much  interest.  Have  you  started  saving  for  retirement?  Consider  starting  a  Roth  IRA  (if  you  are  in  the  USA)  with  some  of  the  money  for  tax  advantages.  It's  up  to  you  to  decide  how  much  you  should  invest  and  how  much  you  need  to  keep  on  hand  for  emergencies  or  short-term  needs.  There  are  plenty  related  questions  on  this  forum  you  can  browse.
321049	What  is  your  risk  tolerance?    Personally  I  invest  about  $5k  in  digital  currency  as  an  experiment.  A  lot  of  people  told  me  I  am  stupid,  which  I  agree  at  some  point.  I  plan  to  let  the  money  sit  for  5~10  years.  I  can  tell  you  there  is  a  lot  of  emotion  in  the  digital  currency  though.
262180	Put  the  whole  lot  into  a  couple  of  low-cost  broad  index  funds  with  dividends  reinvested  (also  known  as  accumulation  funds)  and  then  don't  look  at  them.  Invest  through  a  low-cost  broker.  There  are  a  number  to  choose  from  and  once  you  start  googling  around  the  theme  of  "index  fund  investing"  you'll  find  them.  The  S&P  500  is  a  popular  index  to  start  with.
433993	If  you  go  to  a  grocery  store  and  purchase  retail  gift  cards  along  with  other  products,  and  you  pay  with  a  credit  card,  your  credit  card  company  generally  does  not  know  what  you  spent  the  money  on;  they  don't  get  an  itemized  receipt.*  If  this  is  the  case  with  your  rewards  card,  then  yes,  you  would  get  the  cashback  reward  on  the  gift  cards,  because  all  the  credit  card  company  knows  is  that  you  spent  $100  at  the  grocery  store;  they  don't  know  (or  care,  really)  that  $50  of  it  was  for  an  Olive  Garden  gift  card.  This,  of  course,  should  be  fairly  easy  to  test.    Buy  the  gift  card,  wait  for  your  statement,  and  see  if  they  included  the  purchase  when  calculating  your  rewards.  *  Note:  I  don't  have  an  American  Express  card,  but  from  some  quick  googling  I  see  that  it  is  possible  that  American  Express  does  actually  receive  itemized  billing  details  on  your  purchases  from  some  merchants.    If  your  grocery  store  is  sending  this  data  to  AmEx,  it  is  possible  that  the  gift  cards  could  be  excluded  from  rewards.    But  again,  I  suggest  you  just  test  it  out  and  see.
441342	In  a  similar  situation  I  wrote  about  How  I  Made  $4,000+  on  a  Cash  Back  Credit  Card  Offer.  The  total  was  actually  $4550,  and  was  from  an  insane  offer  from  a  new  credit  card  my  bank  advertised.  10%  cash  back  on  all  spending  during  the  first  90  days.  I  wondered  if  gift  card  purchases  counted,  and  more  than  store  cards,  I  saw  that  Visa  gift  cards  with  a  $500  value  sold  for  a  $4.95  fee.  A  1%  hit.    It  would  have  been  foolish  to  load  up,  and  realize  that  they  were  somehow  excluded,  so  I  bought  2  and  followed  the  transaction  on  line.  When  I  saw  the  10%  credit,  I  went  full  steam,  and  bought  these,  $2000  at  a  time,  as  that  was  the  limit  CVS  imposed.  In  the  end,  I  stopped  at  $50,000.  (And  the  bank  killed  the  online  offer  about  $25K  into  this,  but  still  honored  my  90  days)  Yes,  I  had  to  make  payments  mid  cycle  to  avoid  the  card  limit  ($20K),  but  in  the  end,  the  bit  of  effort  paid  off.  It  took  a  bit  over  a  year  and  a  half  to  burn  through  them.  In  hindsight,  I'd  do  it  for  $100K  if  the  opportunity  came  up.  Cash  in  the  bank  is  earning  near  zero.        TL:DR  Make  a  small  purchase  and  confirm  your  card  gives  you  the  bonus  you  expect.
253005	Understand  that  buying  a  Starbucks  gift  card  at  the  grocery  store  to  receive  6%  back  on  your  coffee  rather  than  6%  back  on  your  groceries  is  an  exploit  of  a  flaw  in  the  benefits  program,  not  a  feature.    It's  definitely  not  a  blanket  yes  or  no  answer,  the  only  way  to  find  out  is  to  try.  Separately,  I  don't  know  why  you  would  find  this  "concerning."    This  will  vary  greatly  between  merchants  and  cards.    There  will  always  be  new  points  churning  exploits,  they  don't  last  forever  and  you  can't  expect  every  customer  service  rep  to  be  well  versed  in  methods  employed  to  juice  cardmember  programs.  Hell,  a  number  of  years  ago  one  person  figured  out  that  he  could  buy  rolls  of  $1  coins  from  the  US  treasury  with  free  shipping  and  no  additional  fees.    This  guy  was  literally  buying  thousands  of  dollars  of  cash  each  month  to  deposit  and  pay  his  credit  card  bill;  completely  against  the  terms  of  the  treasury  program  for  distributing  the  $1  coins.    A  number  of  people  had  their  cards  and  points/cash  back  revoked  for  that  one.
514281	(I  agree  with  the  answers  above;  would  just  like  to  make  a  couple  of  additional  points.)  It's  a  good  and  simple  strategy  to  try  it  out  with  a  small  amount  as  suggested  by  @JoeTaxpayer♦.  It's  also  generally  safe  to  assert  that  card  issuers  currently  don't  receive  or  actively  look  at  itemized  transaction  details.  But  that  does  not  mean  they  cannot  in  the  future.  Some  stores  utilize  level  3  data  processing,  which  tells  the  card  issuers  exactly  what  you  bought  in  a  transaction.  An  example  of  level  3  data  being  utilized  to  reject  rewards  is  with  Discover,  which  announced  a  10%  cashback  reward  for  any  transactions  made  with  Apple  Pay  last  year.  It  later  introduced  an  additional  term  to  exclude  gift  card  purchases.  And  this  has  been  verified  to  be  effective  -  no  more  reward  on  gift  card  purchases;  clawback  of  cashback  on  existing  gift  card  transactions.  As  far  as  I  know,  Amex  does  receive  and  look  at  some  level  3  data  retrospectively.  That  does  not  necessarily  mean  they  will  claw  back  your  cashback  after  initially  rewarding  the  6%.  But  it  might  show  up  if  you  ever  trigger  an  account  review,  and  be  used  as  evidence  of  your  "abuse"  of  the  program  (which  BTW  is  defined  rather  subjectively).  There  has  been  many  cases  of  account  shutdowns  because  of  this.  Card  issuers  are  also  trying  to  do  a  better  job  preventing  "abuses"  by  proactively  setting  caps  on  rewards  (as  opposed  to  closing  those  accounts  afterwards  and  taking  the  rewards  away  altogether).  Given  the  trend  in  recent  years,  I  have  to  speculate  that  at  some  point  the  card  issuers  would  put  clear  language  in  the  terms  against  gift  card  purchase  and  enforce  it  effectively  (if  they  haven't  already).  This  reward  game  is  constantly  changing.  It's  good  while  it  lasts.  Just  be  prepared  and  don't  get  surprised  when  things  go  south.
404833	I  actually  just  did  that  with  my  Chase  Freedom  card.  They  rotate  categories  every  3  months,  and  from  April-June  it  was  5%  back  at  grocery  stores.    So  I  bought  a  ton  of  gas  cards  and  got  my  5%  back.    Next  I  figured  out  I  would  be  clever  and  buy  a  ton  of  store  gift  cards  (grocery  gift  cards)  right  at  the  end  of  the  quarter,  then  use  those  in  the  future  to  purchase  gas  cards.    Well,  I  just  tried  that  a  couple  days  ago  and  discovered  the  store  refuses  to  sell  a  gift  card  if  you're  paying  with  a  gift  card!    So  now  I'm  stuck  with  $1,000  in  grocery  cards  until  I  use  them  in  actual  grocery  purchases  haha  One  of  the  things  about  this  grocery  store  is  they  partner  with  a  gas  station  on  their  rewards  program.    They  offer  10  cents  off  a  gallon  with  every  $100  spent  in  store,  and  they  double  it  to  20  cents  off  a  gallon  if  you  buy  $100  in  gift  cards.    Then  on  the  back  of  the  receipt  is  a  coupon  for  10  cents  off  per  gallon  --  which  they  double  on  Tuesdays.    Unfortunately  I  think  I'm  one  of  the  only  people  that  takes  this  much  advantage  of  the  program    :-/  Side  note:  I  actually  just  changed  the  billing  cycle  of  my  Chase  Freedom  card  to  end  on  the  24th  of  the  month.    That  way  I  can  charge  a  bunch  of  rewards  in  the  final  6-7  days  of  the  quarter.    And  if  I  have  a  $0  balance  on  the  24th,  my  bill  isn't  due  for  7  weeks  --  interest  free!    And  Chase  Freedom  has  never  cared  if  you  purchase  gift  cards  with  their  quarterly  rewards  program.    I  also  gave  them  a  courtesy  email  giving  the  specific  store  and  $$$  amount  that  was  going  to  be  charged,  and  of  course  they  still  called  me  with  a  'fraud  alert'...
597627	There  is  no  simple  answer  to  your  question.    It  depends  on  many  things,  perhaps  most  notably  what  college  your  daughter  ends  up  going  to  and  what  kind  of  aid  you  hope  to  receive.  Your  daughter  will  probably  fill  out  the  FAFSA  as  part  of  her  financial  aid  application.    Here  is  one  discussion  of  what  parental  assets  "count"  towards  the  Expected  Family  Contribution  on  the  FAFSA.    You  can  find  many  similar  pages  by  googling.    Retirement  accounts  and  primary  residence  are  notable  categories  that  do  not  count.    So,  if  you  were  looking  to  reduce  your  "apparent"  assets  for  aid  purposes,  dumping  money  into  your  mortgage  or  retirement  account  is  a  possibility.  However,  you  should  be  cautious  when  doing  this  type  of  gaming,  because  it's  not  always  clear  exactly  how  it  will  affect  financial  aid.    For  one  thing,  "financial  aid"  includes  both  grants  and  loans.    Everyone  wants  grants,  but  sometimes  increasing  your  "eligibility"  may  just  make  you  (or  your  daughter)  eligible  for  larger  loans,  which  may  not  be  so  great.  Also,  each  college  has  its  own  system  for  allocating  financial  aid.    Individual  schools  may  ask  for  more  detailed  information  (such  as  the  CSS  Profile).    So  strategies  for  minimizing  your  apparent  assets  that  work  for  one  school  may  not  work  for  others.    Some  elite  schools  with  large  endowments  have  generous  aid  policies  that  allow  even  families  with  sizable  incomes  to  pay  little  or  nothing  (e.g.,  Stanford  waives  tuition  for  most  families  with  incomes  under  $125,000).  You  should  probably  research  the  financial  aid  policies  of  schools  your  daughter  is  interested  in.    It  can  be  helpful  to  talk  to  financial  aid  advisors  at  colleges,  as  well  as  high  school  counselors,  not  to  mention  general  financial  advisors  if  you  really  want  to  start  getting  technical  about  what  assets  to  move  around.    Needless  to  say,  it  all  begins  with  talking  with  your  daughter  about  her  thoughts  on  where  to  go.
444405	Here's  how  capital  gains  are  totaled:  Long  and  Short  Term.  Capital  gains  and  losses  are  either  long-term  or      short-term.  It  depends  on  how  long  the  taxpayer  holds  the  property.  If      the  taxpayer  holds  it  for  one  year  or  less,  the  gain  or  loss  is      short-term.  Net  Capital  Gain.    If  a  taxpayer’s  long-term  gains  are  more  than  their      long-term  losses,  the  difference  between  the  two  is  a  net  long-term      capital  gain.  If  the  net  long-term  capital  gain  is  more  than  the  net      short-term  capital  loss,  the  taxpayer  has  a  net  capital  gain.  So  your  net  long-term  gains  (from  all  investments,  through  all  brokers)  are  offset  by  any  net  short-term  loss.    Short  term  gains  are  taxed  separately  at  a  higher  rate.  I'm  trying  to  avoid  realizing  a  long  term  capital  gain,  but  at  the  same  time  trade  the  stock.  If  you  close  in  the  next  year,  one  of  two  things  will  happen  -  either  the  stock  will  go  down,  and  you'll  have  short-term  gains  on  the  short,  or  the  stock  will  go  up,  and  you'll  have  short-term  losses  on  the  short  that  will  offset  the  gains  on  the  stock.    So  I  don;t  see  how  it  reduces  your  tax  liability.    At  best  it  defers  it.
222455	From  reading  the  manual,  SP  means  summary  punching.    Summary  punching  is  the  automatic  preparation  of  one  total  card  to      replace  a  group  of  detail  cards.
484105	The  people  who  cause  this  sort  of  sell-off  immediately  are  mostly  speculators,  short-term  day-traders  and  the  like.  They  realize  that,  because  of  the  lowered  potential  for  earnings  in  the  future,  the  companies  in  question  won't  be  worth  as  much  in  the  future.  They  will  sell  shares  at  the  elevated  price,  including  sometimes  shares  that  they  borrow  for  the  explicit  purpose  of  selling  (short  selling),  until  the  share  price  is  more  reasonable.  Now,  the  other  question  is  why  the  companies  in  question  won't  sell  for  as  much  in  the  future:  Even  if  every  other  company  in  the  world  looks  less  attractive  all  at  once  (global  economic  catastrophe  etc)  people  have  other  options.  They  could  just  put  the  money  in  the  bank,  or  in  corporate  bonds,  or  in  mortgage  bonds,  or  Treasury  bonds,  or  some  other  low-risk  instrument,  or  something  crazy  like  gold.  If  the  expected  return  on  a  stock  doesn't  justify  the  price,  you're  unlikely  to  find  someone  paying  that  price.  So  you  don't  actually  need  to  have  a  huge  sell-off  to  lower  the  price.  You  just  need  a  sell-off  that's  big  enough  that  you  run  out  of  people  willing  to  pay  elevated  prices.
251198	News-driven  investors  tend  to  be  very  short-term  focussed  investors.  They  often  trade  by  using  index  futures  (on  the  S&P  500  index  for  instance).
209359	When  you  short  a  stock,  you  can  lose  an  unlimited  amount  of  money  if  the  trade  goes  against  you.  If  the  shorted  stock  gaps  up  overnight  you  can  lose  more  money  than  you  have  in  your  account.  The  best  case  is  you  make  100%  if  the  stock  goes  to  zero.  And  then  you  have  margin  fees  on  top  of  that.  With  long  positions,  it's  the  other  way  around.  Your  max  loss  is  100%  and  your  gains  are  potentially  unlimited.
39265	In  addition  to  the  higher  risk  as  pointed  out  by  @JamesRoth,  you  also  need  to  consider  that  there  are  regulations  against  'naked  shorting'  so  you  generally  need  to  either  own  the  security,  or  have  someone  that  is  willing  to  'loan'  the  security  to  you  in  order  to  sell  short.    If  you  own  a  stock  you  are  shorting,  the  IRS  could  view  the  transaction  as  a  Sell  followed  by  a  buy  taking  place  in  a  less  than  30  day  period  and  you  could  be  subject  to  wash-sale  rules.    This  added  complexity  (most  often  the  finding  of  someone  to  loan  you  the  security  you  are  shorting)  is  another  reason  such  trades  are  considered  more  advanced.  You  should  also  be  aware  that  there  are  currently  a  number  of  proposals  to  re-instate  the  'uptick  rule'  or  some  circuit-breaker  variant.  Designed  to  prevent  short-sellers  from  driving  down  the  price  of  a  stock  (and  conducting  'bear  raids  etc)  the  first  requires  that  a  stock  trade  at  the  same  or  higher  price  as  prior  trades  before  you  can  submit  a  short.    In  the  latter  shorting  would  be  prohibited  after  a  stock  price  had  fallen  a  given  percentage  in  a  given  amount  of  time.    In  either  case,  should  such  a  rule  be  (re)established  then  you  could  face  limitations  attempting  to  execute  a  short  which  you  would  not  need  to  worry  about  doing  simple  buys  or  sells.      As  to  vehicles  that  would  do  this  kind  of  thing  (if  you  are  convinced  we  are  in  a  bear  market  and  willing  to  take  the  risk)  there  are  a  number  of  ETF's  classified  as  'Inverse  Exchange  Traded  Funds  (ETF's)  for  a  variety  of  markets  that  via  various  means  seek  to  deliver  a  return  similar  to  that  of  'shorting  the  market'  in  question.    One  such  example  for  a  common  broad  market  is  ticker  SH  the  ProShares  Short  S&P500  ETF,  which  seeks  to  deliver  a  return  that  is  the  inverse  of  the  S&P500  (and  as  would  be  predicted  based  on  the  roughly  +15%  performance  of  the  S&P500  over  the  last  12  months,  SH  is  down  roughly  -15%  over  the  same  period).    The  Wikipedia  article  on  inverse  ETF's  lists  a  number  of  other  such  funds  covering  various  markets.      I  think  it  should  be  noted  that  using  such  a  vehicle  is  a  pretty  'aggressive  bet'  to  take  in  reaction  to  the  belief  that  a  bear  market  is  imminent.    A  more  conservative  approach  would  be  to  simply  take  money  out  of  the  market  and  place  it  in  something  like  CD's  or  Treasury  instruments.    In  that  case,  you  preserve  your  capital,  regardless  of  what  happens  in  the  market.  Using  an  inverse  ETF  OTOH  means  that  if  the  market  went  bull  instead  of  bear,  you  would  lose  money  instead  of  merely  holding  your  position.
35102	The  margin  rules  are  also  more  complicated.    A  simple  buy  on  a  non-margin  account  will  never  run  into  margin  rules  and  you  can  just  wait  out  any  dips  if  you  have  confidence  the  stock  will  recover.    A  "simple"  short  sell  might  get  you  a  call  from  your  broker  that  you  have  a  margin  call,  and  you  can't  wait  it  out  without  putting  more  money  in.    Personally  I  have  trouble  keeping  the  short  sale  margin  rules  straight  in  my  head,  at  least  compared  to  a  long  sale.  I  got  in  way  over  my  head  shorting  AMZN  once,  and  lost  a  lot  of  money  because  I  thought  it  was  overvalued  at  the  time,  but  it  just  kept  going  up  and  I  wanted  it  to  go  down.      I've  never  gotten  stuck  like  that  on  a  long  position.
109132	Many  colleges  have  offices  that  can  help  students  find  off  campus  housing.  They  will  have  information  about  rooms  being  let  by  families,  and  about  houses  being  shared  by  groups  of  students.  The  biggest  issue  is  that  many  of  the  best  places  were  filled  months  ago.  With  only  a  month  to  go  before  classes  start  time  is  tight.  You  can  also  look  for  electronic  listings  organized  through  a  campus  newspaper.    The  advantage  of  going  through  university  resources  is  that  they  will  have  more  information  regarding  the  types  of  students  they  are  looking  for.  A  house  full  of  undergrads  is  different  than  a  family  house  that  rents  only  to  young  professors.
88396	There  are  services,  usually  associated  with  real  estate  agents,  that  provide  apartment  search  services  for  relocating  professionals.  I  was  very  underimpressed  when  I  was  offered  the  use  of  such  a  service  and  did  better  on  my  own,  but  I  did  have  the  company  paying  for  a  hotel  room  while  I  searched  so  I  had  time  to  investigate  alternative  channels  --  and  in  fact  found  and  took  a  place  being  offered  by  a  co-worker's  father.  But  if  you're  really  looking  for  "a  room"  in  a  shared  living  situation,  and  you  aren't  already  on  campus  talking  to  other  students,  I  agree  that  the  school's  housing  office,  or  the  dorms  and/or  fraternity  houses  and/or  independent  living  groups  are  your  best  bet.    In  a  college  town  most  roommate  openings  get  snapped  up  pretty  quickly  and  are  more  likely  to  go  to  someone  who  is  a  known  or  vouched-for  quantity.
41130	First,  do  you  get  charged  a  commission  or  other  fee  for  reinvesting?      Second,  why  would  capital  gains  and  dividends  be  grouped  together?  If  the  broker  charges  you  for  that  run  away.  As  Joe  explained,  it  is  done  as  a  courtesy.  Doesn't  this  mean  if  I  sell  the  stock,  the  profit  will  be  used  to  buy      that  stock  right  back?  No,  this  is  only  the  capital  gains  distributions  of  funds.  Lastly,  there  are  two  additional  checkbox  options  I  was  hoping      somebody  could  explain:  "All  equity  positions  currently  held  in  this      account"  and  "Future  equity  purchases,  transfers,  and  deposits  to  this      account".  "All  equity  positions"  means  your  selection  will  be  valid  for  all  the  positions  you  already  have.  "Future  positions"  means  it  will  only  affect  future  positions,  not  the  ones  you  already  have.  For  example:  FOLLOW-UP:  Looking  around,  some  people  suggest  not  doing  this  for      taxable  accounts  because  it  complicates  cost  basis  reporting.  Is  this      a  valid  concern?  Doesn't  the  brokerage  handle  that  and  send  you  the      information  when  you  sell  the  stock?  Yes,  because  you  end  up  with  tons  of  positions  and  you  need  to  track  the  cost  basis  for  each.  Brokers  are  required  to  report  cost-basis  on  1099-B  now,  so  its  less  of  a  problem,  but  before  2011  you'd  have  10's  of  positions  each  year  (if  you  have  a  monthly  dividend,  for  example)  each  with  different  cost  basis,  and  you'd  usually  sell  them  all  at  once.  Go  figure  the  gain.  So  the  new  1099-B  reporting  regulations  help  a  little  on  this,  but  it  only  kicks  in  for  everything  starting  of  2013  IIRC.  Fortunately,  for  some  investments  (mutual  funds,  mainly)  you  may  chose  averaging,  but  it  has  drawbacks  as  well.
562481	No,  the  reinvestment  is  done  as  a  courtesy.  Consider,  one  can  have,  say,  100  shares  of  a  $50  stock.  A  2%  dividend  is  $100/yr  or  $25/quarter.  It  would  be  a  pretty  bad  deal  if  brokers  charged  you  even  $5  for  that  trade.  When  cap  gains  and  dividends  are  grouped  as  you  suggest,  it  refers  to  Mutual  Funds.  My  funds  will  have  a  year  end  dividend  and  cap  gain  distribution.  In  a  non-retirement  account,  one  has  to  pay  the  tax  due,  and  be  sure  to  add  this  to  your  cost  basis,  as  it's  money  you  are  effectively  adding  to  your  account.  It  does  not  mean  cap  gain  the  same  as  when  you  sell  your  shares  of  Apple  for  a  huge  gain.    Those  check  boxes  seem  to  offer  you  a  chance  to  put  all  your  holding  on  the  same  reinvestment  plan  for  div/cap  gain.  You  should  also  be  able  to  choose  one  by  one  what  you'd  like  to  do.
481999	I'd  like  to  add  that  many  companies  offer  Divident  Re-Investment  Plans  or  DRIPs,  which  is  basically  a  regular  automatic  stock  purchase  program.  More  info  here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_reinvestment_plan.  While  your  stock  broker  may  offer  dividend  reinvestment,  this  is  not  the  same  as  a  DRIP.  DRIPs  are  offered  directly  by  the  company,  rather  than  the  stock  broker.  They  have  the  added  benefits  that  the  stock  purchases  are  almost  always  commission-free,  and  in  some  cases,  the  company  even  offers  a  discount  on  the  stock  price.  It  can  take  a  little  more  effort  to  get  enrolled  in  a  DRIP,  but  if  you  are  interested  in  holding  the  stock  long-term,  this  is  a  good  option  to  consider.
442127	I  have  found  The  DRiP  Investing  Resource  Center  to  be  a  useful  resource  for  more  information  about  DRIP  investing.    Moneypaper.com  offers  a  list  of  companies  offering  both  direct  purchase  options  and  dividend  reinvestment  plans.  For  those  offering  dividend  reinvestment  plans,  but  not  direct  purchase,  you  have  the  option  of  using  a  service  to  purchase  your  first  shares  to  enroll  in  the  DRIP  program.    The  tax  paperwork  for  DRIPs  is  a  pain  due  to  the  partial  shares  purchased  over  time  when  you  have  to  figure  out  your  own  cost  basis  upon  sale  of  shares  ,  but  a  spreadsheet  and  a  FIFO  (first  in  first  out)  approach  makes  it  not  too  much  of  a  headache.      -MU
594595	The  issue  is  that  the  lender  used  two  peoples  income,  debts,  and  credit  history  to  loan  both  of  you  money  to  purchase  a  house.  The  only  way  to  get  a  person  off  the  loan,  is  to  get  a  new  loan  via  refinancing.  The  new  loan  will  then  be  based  on  the  income,  debt,  and  credit  history  of  one  person.  There  is  no  paperwork  you  can  sign,  or  the  ex-spouse  can  sign,  that  will  force  the  original  lender  to  remove  somebody  from  the  loan.  There  is  one  way  that  a  exchange  of  money  between  the  two  of  you  could  work:  The  ex-spouse  will  have  to  sign  paperwork  to  prove  that  it  is  not  a  loan  that  you  will  have  to  payback.  I  picked  the  number  20K  for  a  reason.  If  the  amount  of  the  payment  is  above  14K  they  will  have  to  document  for  the  IRS  that  this  is  a  gift,  and  the  amount  above  14K  will  be  counted  as  part  of  their  estate  when  they  die.  If  the  amount  of  the  payment  is  less  than  14K  they  don't  even  have  to  tell  the  IRS.  If  the  ex-souse  has  remarried  or  you  have  remarried  the  multiple  payments  can  be  constructed  to  exceed  the  14K  limit.
290691	I'm  guessing  since  I  don't  know  the  term,  but  it  sounds  like  you're  asking  about  the  technique  whereby  a  loan  is  used  to  gather  multiple  years'  gift  allowance  into  a  single  up-front  transfer.  For  the  subsequent  N  years,  the  giver  pays  the  installments  on  the  loan  for  the  recipient,  at  a  yearly  amount  small  enough  to  avoid  triggering  Gift  Tax.  You  still  have  to  pay  income  tax  on  the  interest  received  (even  though  you're  giving  them  the  money  to  pay  you),  and  you  must  charge  a  certain  minimum  interest  (or  more  accurately,  if  you  charge  less  than  that  they  tax  you  as  if  the  loan  was  earning  that  minimum).  Historically  this  was  used  by  relatively  wealthy  folks,  since  the  cost  of  lawyers  and  filing  the  paperwork  and  bookkeeping  was  high  enough  that  most  folks  never  found  out  this  workaround  existed,  and  few  were  moving  enough  money  to  make  those  costs  worthwhile.  But  between  the  "Great  Recession"  and  the  internet,  this  has  become  much  more  widely  known,  and  there  are  services  which  will  draw  up  standard  paperwork,  have  a  lawyer  sanity-check  it  for  your  local  laws,  file  the  official  mortgage  lien  (not  actually  needed  unless  you  want  the  recipient  to  also  be  able  to  write  off  the  interest  on  their  taxes),  and  provide  a  payments-processing  service  if  you  do  expect  part  or  all  of  the  loan  to  be  paid  by  the  recipient.  Or  whatever  subset  of  those  services  you  need.    I've  done  this.  In  my  case  it  cost  me  a  bit  under  $1000  to  set  up  the  paperwork  so  I  could  loan  a  friend  a  sizable  chunk  of  cash  and  have  it  clearly  on  record  as  a  loan,  not  a  gift.  The  amount  in  question  was  large  enough,  and  the  interpersonal  issues  tricky  enough,  that  this  was  a  good  deal  for  us.  Obviously,  run  the  numbers.  Websearching  "family  loan"    will  find  much  more  detail  about  how  this  works  and  what  it  can  and  can't  do,  along  with  services  specializing  in  these  transactions.  NOTE:  If  you  are  actually  selling  something,  such  as  your  share  of  a  house,  this  dance  may  or  may  not  make  sense.  Again,  run  the  numbers,  and  if  in  doubt  get  expert  advice  rather  than  trusting  strangers  on  the  web.  (Go  not  to  the  Internet  for  legal  advice,  for  it  shall  say  both  mu  and  ni.)
204209	There  are  things  that  are  clearly  beyond  me  as  well.  Cash  per  share  is  $12.61  but  the  debt  looks  like  $30  or  so  per  share.  I  look  at  that,  and  the  $22  negative  book  value  and  don't  see  where  the  shareholders  are  able  to  recoup  anything.
30996	There  are  no  legal  restrictions  on  doing  this.  If  you're  living  in  the  UK,  just  open  an  account  like  any  other  resident  of  the  UK  would.
240550	Yes,  but  only  in  a  relatively  short  term.  False  news  or  speculations  can  definitely  change  the  stock  price,  sometimes  even  significantly.  However,  the  stock  price  will  eventually  (in  the  long-term)  correct  itself  and  head  to  the  right  direction.
72529	It's  a  form  of  debt  issued  by  the  United  States  Treasury.  As  the  name  implies,  a  10-year  note  is  held  for  10  years  (after  which  you  get  the  face  value  in  cash),  and  it  pays  interest  twice  per  year.  It's  being  used  in  the  calculator  to  stand  for  a  readily  available,  medium-term,  nearly  risk-free  investment,  as  a  means  of  "discounting"  the  value  that  the  company  gains.  The  explanation  for  why  the  discounting  is  done  can  be  found  on  the  page  you  linked.  As  a  Canadian  you  could  use  the  yield  of  comparable  Canadian  treasury  securities  as  quoted  by  Bank  of  Canada  (which  seem  to  have  had  the  bottom  fall  out  since  the  new  year),  although  I  don't  suppose  American  notes  would  be  hard  for  a  Canadian  investor  to  come  by,  so  if  you  wanted  to  be  conservative  you  could  use  the  US  figure  as  long  as  it's  higher.
479697	Investing  requires  capital,  and  the  fastest  way  to  get  the  capital  is  to  develop  good  saving  habits.  Investing  is  an  ongoing  process  to  help  you  accumulate  wealth,  so  to  take  advantage  of  compounding,  the  earlier  you  start,  the  better.    I  can  suggest  a  few  pointers  to  get  you  started  on  the  investing  journey.  Godspeed!  :)
518340	It  seems  like  this  was  a  "stock  for  stock"  transaction.  That  is,  your  company  was  acquired,  not  for  cash,  but  for  the  stock  of  Company  X  in  a  deal  that  your  company's  board  of  directors  "signed  off"  on.    Your  company  no  longer  exists,  and  that's  why  your  stock  was  cancelled.  The  acquirer  will  be  sending  you  an  equivalent  amount  of  stock  in  their  Company,  X.  You  don't  need  to  worry  about  taxes,  only  accounting,  because  this  is  a  "non-cash"  transaction.  What  this  means  that  your  cost  basis  in  the  stock  of  Company  X  will  be  what  you  paid  for  the  original  company's  stock  (not  its  value  on  the  day  of  the  merger,  which  may  be  higher  or  lower  than  what  you  paid).
72845	There  are  quite  a  few  regulations  on  "Insider  Trading".  Blackouts  are  one  of  the  means  companies  adopt  to  comply  with  "Insider  Trading"  regulations,  mandating  employees  to  refrain  from  selling/buying  during  the  notified  period.  Once  you  leave  the  employment:  So  unless  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  you  to  sell/buy  the  options,  wait  for  some  time  and  then  indulge  in  trade.
463831	Goal  -  What  is  it  that  you  are  saving  or  investing  to  have:  Educational  costs,  retirement,  vacation,  home,  or  something  else.  Dollar  figure  and  time  period  would  be  the  keys  here.  Risk  tolerance  -  What  kind  of  risks  are  you  prepared  to  accept  with  the  investment  choices  you  are  making?  What  kind  of  time  commitment  do  these  investments  have  and  are  you  prepared  to  spend  the  time  necessary  for  this  to  work?  This  is  about  how  wild  are  the  swings  as  well  as  what  beliefs  do  you  have  that  may  play  a  role  here.  Strategy  -  Do  you  know  what  kind  of  buy  and  sell  conditions  you  have?  Do  you  know  what  kind  of  models  you  are  following?  This  is  really  important  to  have  before  you  buy  something  as  afterward  you  may  have  buyer's  remorse  that  may  cause  more  problems  in  a  sense.  Record  keeping  -  Do  you  know  what  kinds  of  records  you'll  need  for  tax  purposes?  Do  you  know  how  long  to  hold  onto  records?  Those  would  be  the  main  ones  to  my  mind.
232207	does  it  still  count  as  a  capital  gain  or  loss?  Yes.  Is  it  essentially  treated  like  you  sold  the  stock  at  the  price  of  the  buy-out?    Yes.  Do  you  still  get  a  1099-B  from  your  broker?  Yes.
472537	The  price  of  a  share  has  two  components:  Bid:  The  highest  price  that  someone  who  wants  to  buy  shares  is  willing  to  pay  for  them.  Ask:  The  lowest  price  that  someone  who  has  a  share  is  willing  to  sell  it  for.  The  ask  is  always  higher  than  the  bid,  since  if  they  were  equal  the  buyer  and  seller  would  have  a  deal,  make  a  transaction,  and  that  repeats  until  they  are  not  equal.  For  stock  with  high  volume,  there  is  usually  a  very  small  difference  between  the  bid  and  ask,  but  a  stock  with  lower  volume  could  have  a  major  difference.  When  you  say  that  the  share  price  is  $100,  that  could  mean  different  things.  You  could  be  talking  about  the  price  that  the  shares  sold  for  in  the  most  recent  transaction  (and  that  might  not  even  be  between  the  current  bid  and  ask),  or  you  could  be  talking  about  any  of  the  bid,  the  ask,  or  some  value  in  between  them.  If  you  have  shares  that  you  are  interested  in  selling,  then  the  bid  is  what  you  could  immediately  sell  a  share  for.  If  you  sell  a  share  for  $100,  that  means  someone  was  willing  to  pay  you  $100  for  it.  If  after  buying  it,  they  still  want  to  buy  more  for  $100  each,  or  someone  else  does,  then  the  bid  is  still  $100,  and  you  haven't  changed  the  price.  If  no  one  else  is  willing  to  pay  more  than  $90  for  a  share,  then  the  price  would  drop  to  $90  next  time  a  transaction  takes  place  and  thats  what  you  would  be  able  to  immediately  sell  the  next  share  for.
434904	Unless  other  people  believe  you  have  a  reason  for  selling  at  a  lower  price,  your  sale  probably  has  no  lasting  effect  at  all  on  the  market.  Of  course,  if  people  see  you  dump  a  few  million  dollars'  worth  of  shares  at  a  discount,  they  may  be  inclined  to  believe  you  have  a  reason.  But  if  you  just  sell  a  few,  they  will  conclude  the  reason  is  just  that  you  needed  cash  in  a  hurry.
162771	As  other  uses  have  pointed  out,  your  example  is  unusual  in  that  is  does  not  include  any  time  value  or  volatility  value  in  the  quoted  premiums,  the  premiums  you  quote  are  only  intrinsic  values.    For  well  in-the-money  options,  the  intrinsic  value  will  certainly  be  the  vast  majority  of  the  premium,  but  not  the  sole  component.  Having  said  that,  the  answer  would  clearly  be  that  the  buyer  should  buy  the  $40  call  at  a  premium  of  $10.    The  reason  is  that  the  buyer  will  pay  less  for  the  option  and  therefore  risk  less  money,  or  buy  more  options  for  the  same  amount  of  money.    Since  the  buyer  is  assuming  that  the  price  will  rise,  the  return  that  will  be  realised  will  be  the  same  in  gross  terms,  but  higher  in  relative  terms  for  the  buyer  of  the  $40  call.      For  example,  if  the  underlying  price  goes  to  $60,  then  the  buyer  of  the  $40  call  would  (potentially)  double  their  money  when  the  premium  goes  from  $10  to  $20,  while  the  buyer  of  the  $30  call  would  realise  a  (potential)  50%  profit  when  the  premium  goes  from  $20  to  $30.  Considering  the  situation  beyond  your  scenario,  things  are  more  difficult  if  the  bet  goes  wrong.    If  the  underlying  prices  expires  at  under  $40,  then  the  buyer  of  the  $40  call  will  be  better  off  in  gross  terms  but  may  be  worse  off  in  relative  terms  (if  it  expires  above  $30).    If  the  underlying  price  expires  between  $40  and  $50,  then  the  buy  of  the  $30  will  be  better  off  in  relative  term,  having  lost  a  smaller  percentage  of  their  money.
384165	Your  scenario  depicts  2  "in  the  money"  options,  not  "at  the  money".  The  former  is  when  the  share  price  is  higher  than  the  option  strike,  the  second  is  when  share  price  is  right  at  strike.  I  agree  this  is  a  highly  unlikely  scenario,  because  everyone  pricing  options  knows  what  everyone  else  in  that  stock  is  doing.  Much  about  an  option  has  everything  to  do  with  the  remaining  time  to  expiration.  Depending  on  how  much  more  the  buyer  believes  the  stock  will  go  up  before  hitting  the  expiration  date,  that  could  make  a  big  difference  in  which  option  they  would  buy.  I  agree  with  the  others  that  if  you're  seeing  this  as  "real  world"  then  there  must  be  something  going  on  behind  the  scenes  that  someone  else  knows  and  you  don't.  I  would  tread  with  caution  in  such  a  situation  and  do  my  homework  before  making  any  move.      The  other  big  factor  that  makes  your  question  harder  to  answer  more  concisely  is  that  you  didn't  tell  us  what  the  expiration  dates  on  the  options  are.  This  makes  a  difference  in  how  you  evaluate  them.  We  could  probably  be  much  more  helpful  to  you  if  you  could  give  us  that  information.

261965	I  think  the  IRS  doc  you  want  is  http://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#en_US_2010_publink100010601  I  believe  the  answers  are:
590010	What  JoeTaxpayer  means  is  that  you  can  sell  one  ETF  and  buy  another  that  will  perform  substantially  the  same  during  the  30  day  wash  sale  period  without  being  considered  substantially  the  same  from  a  wash  sale  perspective  more  easily  than  you  could  with  an  individual  stock.  For  example,  you  could  sell  an  S&P  500  index  ETF  and  then  temporarily  buy  a  DJIA  index  ETF.  As  these  track  different  indexes,  they  are  not  considered  to  be  substantially  the  same  for  wash  sale  purposes,  but  for  a  short  term  investing  period,  their  performance  should  still  be  substantially  the  same.
275340	No,  there's  nothing  special  in  mutual  funds  or  ETFs.  Wash  sale  rules  apply  to  any  asset.
261902	The  IRS  rules  are  actually  the  same.    26  U.S.  Code  §  1091  -  Loss  from  wash  sales  of  stock  or  securities  In      the  case  of  any  loss  claimed  to  have  been  sustained  from  any  sale  or      other  disposition  of  shares  of  stock  or  securities  where  it  appears      that,  within  a  period  beginning  30  days  before  the  date  of  such  sale      or  disposition  and  ending  30  days  after  such  date,  the  taxpayer  has      acquired  (by  purchase  or  by  an  exchange  on  which  the  entire  amount  of      gain  or  loss  was  recognized  by  law),  or  has  entered  into  a  contract  or      option  so  to  acquire,  substantially  identical  stock  or  securities,      then  no  deduction  shall  be  allowed...  What  you  should  take  away  from  the  quote  above  is  "substantially  identical  stock  or  securities."  With  stocks,  one  company  may  happen  to  have  a  high  correlation,  Exxon  and  Mobil  come  to  mind,  before  their  merger  of  course.  With  funds  or  ETFs,  the  story  is  different.  The  IRS  has  yet  to  issue  rules  regarding  what  level  of  overlap  or  correlation  makes  two  funds  or  ETFs  "substantially  identical."    Last  month,  I  wrote  an  article,  Tax  Loss  Harvesting,  which  analyses  the  impact  of  taking  losses  each  year.  I  study  the  2000's  which  showed  an  average  loss  of  1%  per  year,  a  9%  loss  for  the  decade.  Tax  loss  harvesting  made  the  decade  slightly  positive,  i.e.  an  annual  boost  of  approx  1%.
36723	In  US  public  stock  markets  there  is  no  difference  between  the  actions  individual  retail  traders  are  "permitted"  to  take  and  the  actions  institutional/corporate  traders  are  "permitted"  to  take.    The  only  difference  is  the  cost  of  those  actions.    For  example,  if  you  become  a  Registered  Market  Maker  on,  say,  the  BATS  stock  exchange,  you'll  get  some  amazing  rebates  and  reduced  transaction  prices;  however,  in  order  to  qualify  for  Registered  Market  Maker  status  you  have  to  maintain  constant  orders  in  the  book  for  hundreds  of  equities  at  significant  volumes.    An  individual  retail  trader  is  certainly  permitted  to  do  that,  but  it's  probably  too  expensive.  Algorithmic  trading  is  not  the  same  as  automated  trading  (algorithmic  trading  can  be  non-automated,  and  automated  trading  can  be  non-algorithmic),  and  both  can  be  anywhere  from  low-  to  high-frequency.    A  low-frequency  automated  strategy  is  essentially  indistinguishable  from  a  person  clicking  their  mouse  several  times  per  day,  so:  no,  from  a  legal  or  regulatory  perspective  there  is  no  special  procedure  an  individual  retail  trader  has  to  follow  before  s/he  can  automate  a  trading  strategy.    (Your  broker,  on  the  other  hand,  may  have  all  sorts  of  hoops  for  you  to  jump  through  in  order  to  use  their  automation  platform.)  Last  (but  certainly  not  least)  you  will  almost  certainly  lose  money  hand  over  fist  attempting  bid-ask  scalping  as  an  individual  retail  trader,  whether  your  approach  is  algorithmic  or  not,  automated  or  not.    Why?    Because  the  only  way  to  succeed  at  bid-ask  scalping  is  to  (a)  always  be  at/near  the  front  of  the  queue  when  a  price  change  occurs  in  your  favor,  and  (b)  always  cancel  your  resting  orders  before  they  are  executed  when  a  price  change  occurs  against  you.    Unless  your  algorithms  are  smarter  than  every  other  algorithm  in  the  industry,  an  individual  retail  trader  operating  through  a  broker's  trading  platform  cannot  react  quickly  enough  to  succeed  at  either  of  those.    You  would  have  to  eschew  the  broker  and  buy  direct  market  access  to  even  have  a  chance,  and  that's  the  point  at  which  you're  no  longer  a  retail  trader.  Good  luck!
581514	In  this  type  of  strategy  profit  is  made  when  the  shares  go  down  as  your  main  position  is  the  short  trade  of  the  common  stock.  The  convertible  instruments  will  tend  to  move  in  about  the  same  direction  as  the  underlying  (what  it  can  be  converted  to)  but  less  violently  as  they  are  traded  less  (lower  volatility  and  lower  volume  in  the  market  on  both  sides),  however,  they  are  not  being  used  to  make  a  profit  so  much  as  to  hedge  against  the  stock  going  up.  Since  both  the  bonds  and  the  preference  shares  are  higher  on  the  list  to  be  repaid  if  the  company  declares  bankruptcy  and  the  bonds  pay  out  a  fixed  amount  of  interest  as  well,  both  also  help  protect  against  problems  that  may  occur  with  a  long  position  in  the  common  stock.    Essentially  the  plan  with  this  strategy  is  to  earn  fixed  income  on  the  bonds  whilst  the  stock  price  drops  and  then  to  sell  both  the  bonds  and  buy  the  stock  back  on  the  market  to  cover  the  short  position.  If  the  prediction  that  the  stock  will  fall  is  wrong  then  you  are  still  earning  fixed  income  on  the  debt  and  are  able  to  convert  it  into  stock  at  the  higher  price  to  cover  the  short  sale  eliminating,  or  reducing,  the  loss  made  on  the  short  sale.  Effectively  the  profit  here  is  made  on  the  spread  between  the  price  of  the  bond,  accounting  for  the  conversion  price,  and  the  price  of  the  stock  and  that  fixed  income  is  less  volatile  (except  usually  in  the  junk  market)  than  stock.
149696	In  a  (not  Roth)  IRA,  withdrawals  are  generally  already  taxed  as  regular  income.  So  there  should  be  no  tax  disadvantage  to  earning  payment  in  lieu  of  dividends.    It's  possible  that  there  is  an  exception  for  IRAs  but  I  was  unable  to  find  one  and  I  cannot  see  the  reason  for  one  since  the  dividend  tax  rate  is  usually  lower  than  the  income  tax  rate  (which  is  why  some  company  owners  elect  to  receive  part  of  the  company  profits  via  dividend  rather  than  all  through  their  salary).
406192	As  mentioned  by  others,  dollar  cost  averaging  is  just  a  fancy  term  for  how  many  shares  your  individual  purchases  get  when  you  are  initially  adding  money  to  your  investment  accounts.    Once  the  money  is  invested,  annual  or  quarterly  rebalancing  serves  the  purpose  of  taking  advantage  of  higher  rates  of  growth  in  particular  market  sectors.  You  define  the  asset  allocation  based  on  your  risk  profile,  time  to  retirement,  etc.,  then  you  periodically  sell  the  shares  of  the  investments  that  have  grown  faster  than  the  rest  and  buy  more  shares  of  the  investments  that  are  relatively  cheaper.
374284	Dollar  cost  averaging  doesn't  (or  shouldn't)  apply  here.  DCA  is  the  natural  way  we  invest  in  the  market,  buying  in  by  a  steady  dollar  amount  each  pay  period,  so  over  time  we  can  buy  more  shares  when  the  market  is  down,  and  fewer  when  it's  higher.  It's  more  psychological  than  financial.  The  fact  is  that  given  the  market  rises,  on  average,  over  time,  if  one  has  a  lump  sum  to  invest,  it  should  be  deployed  based  on  other  factors,  not  just  DCA'd  in.  As  I  said,  DCA  is  just  how  we  all  naturally  invest  from  our  income.    The  above  has  nothing  to  do  with  your  situation.  You  are  invested  and  wish  to  swap  funds.  If  the  funds  are  with  the  same  broker,  you  should  be  able  to  execute  this  at  the  closing  price.  The  sell  and  buy  happen  after  hours  and  you  wake  up  the  next  day  with  the  newly  invested  portfolio.    If  funds  are  getting  transferred  from  broker  to  broker,  you  do  have  a  risk.  The  risk  that  they  take  time,  say  even  2  days  when  funds  are  not  invested.  A  shame  to  lose  a  2%  market  move  as  the  cost  of  moving  brokers.  In  this  case,  I'd  do  mine  and  my  wife's  at  different  times.  To  reduce  that  risk.
72360	The  first  step  I  would  do  is  determine  the  asset  class  mixture  for  your  current  portfolio  and  the  mixture  for  your  new  one.  If  they  are  the  same  and  all  you  are  doing  is  changing  the  funds  that  you  use  to  invest  in  that  mixture  of  asset  class  then  just  do  the  change  all  at  once.  In  this  case  there  is  no  market  risk  as  you  are  just  swapping  funds  (hopefully  to  ones  that  you  feel  will  better  track  the  underlying  asset  classes).    If  you  are  also  changing  your  asset  class  mixture,  then  it  depends  on  how  large  the  change  is.  I  would  still  do  the  whole  change  at  once.  But  if  you  are  worried  about  fluctuations  then  you  could  slowly  rebalance  into  your  final  position  by  taking  a  couple  of  intermediary  steps.  I  would  still  change  all  of  the  fund  first  but  maybe  in  a  mix  closer  to  your  current  asset  mix  and  then  over  the  next  couple  of  months  adjust  the  ratios  to  reach  your  final  desired  asset  mix.
251893	If  you  have  a  great  technical  trading  system  that  gets  you  winning  trading  80-85%  of  the  time  in  backtesting,  the  question  should  be  why  are  you  not  trading  it?  To  get  a  better  idea  of  how  good  your  trading  system  is  you  should  work  out  your  expectancy  per  trade.  This  will  tell  you  how  much  you  should  make  on  average  for  every  trade  you  take.  Expectancy  not  only  considers  your  win  rate  but  also  you  win  size  to  loss  size  ratio.  For  example  if  you  are  getting  winning  trades  80%  of  the  time  but  your  average  win  size  is  $100,  and  your  20%  of  losses  average  $500,  then  you  will  still  be  losing  money.  You  should  be  aiming  for  an  average  win  size  of  at  least  2.5  to  3  times  you  average  loss  size.  This  will  provide  you  a  profitable  trading  system  even  if  your  win  rate  is  50%.  If  your  trading  system  is  really  that  good  and  provides  a  win  size  of  at  least  2.5  times  your  loss  size  then  you  should  be  actively  trading  it.  Also,  if  you  put  your  trading  system  out  there  in  the  public  domain  together  with  your  trading  results  you  will  actually  find  that,  quite  opposite  to  what  the  consensus  above  is,  your  results  from  your  trading  plan  should  actually  improve  further.  The  more  people  acting  on  the  outcome  of  a  signal  in  the  same  direction  the  higher  the  probability  that  the  movement  in  the  desired  direction  will  actually  occur.  If  you  are  looking  to  make  money  from  your  trading  ideas,  no  one  will  pay  anything  unless  you  have  real  results  to  back  it  up.  So  if  you  are  so  confident  about  your  system  you  should  start  trading  it  with  real  money.  Of  course  you  should  start  off  small  and  build  it  up  over  time  as  your  results  eventuate  as  per  your  simulations.
397166	The  put  will  expire  and  you  will  need  to  purchase  a  new  one.  My  advise  will  be  that  the  best  thing  is  to  sell  more  calls  so  your  delta  from  the  short  call  will  be  similr  to  the  delta  from  the  equity  holding.
65618	I  assume  that  when  you  say  'the  DOW'  that  you  actually  mean  the  general  market.    The  ticker  symbol  for  the  general  market  is  SPY  (called  a  'Spider').  The  ticker  symbol  for  Nasdaq  is  QQQ.    SPY  currently  pays  2.55%  in  dividends  in  a  year.    QQQ  currently  pays  1.34%  in  dividends  in  a  year.
307828	The  futures  market  trades  24  hours  a  day,  5.5  days  a  week.  S&P  500  futures  market  continues  trading,  and  this  gives  pricing  exposure  and  influences  the  individual  stocks  when  they  resume  trading  in  US  session.
63565	My  original  answer  contained  a  fundamental  error:  it  turns  out  that  it  is  not  true  that  any  exchange  can  create  its  own  product  to  track  any  underlying  index.    If  the  underlying  index  is  copyrighted  (such  as  the  S&P  indices,  Russell  indices,  Dow  Jones  indices,  etc.)  then  the  exchange  must  enter  into  a  licensing  agreement  (usually  exclusive)  with  the  copyright  holder  in  order  to  use  the  index's  formula  (and  name).    Without  such  a  license  the  exchange  would  only  be  able  to  approximate  the  underlying  index,  and  I  don't  think  that  happens  very  much  (because  how  would  you  market  such  a  product?).  The  CME  offers  several  futures  (and  other  derivatives)  whose  face  value  is  equivalent  to  some  multiple  of  the  S&P500's  value  on  the  date  when  the  product  expires.    When  such  a  product  is  actively  traded,  it  may  serve  as  a  reasonable  indicator  of  the  "market"'s  expectation  of  the  S&P500's  future  value.  So,  you  could  pay  attention  to  the  front  month  of  the  CME's  S&P  500  Mini  future,  which  trades  from  17:00-16:00  Chicago  time,  Sunday  night  through  Friday  afternoon.    But  remember  that  the  prices  quoted  there  are  As  another  example,  if  you  care  about  the  Russell  2000  index,  until  2017  the  ICE  Exchange  happened  to  hold  the  license  for  its  derivatives.    They  traded  from  20:00-17:30  New  York  time,  Sunday  night  through  Friday  afternoon.    But  in  mid-2017  CME  bought  that  license  as  well,  so  now  you'll  want  to  track  it  here.  Moral:  There's  almost  always  some  "after  hours"  product  out  there  tracking  whatever  index  you  care  about,  but  you  may  have  to  do  some  digging  to  find  it,  and  it  might  not  be  all  that  useful  for  your  specific  purpose.
418150	If  a  stock  that  makes  up  a  big  part  of  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial      Average  decided  to  issue  a  huge  number  of  additional  shares,  that  will      make  the  index  go  up.  At  least  this  is  what  should  happen,  since  an      index  is  basically  a  sum  of  the  market  cap  of  the  contributing      companies.  No,  indices  can  have  various  weightings.  The  DJIA  is  a  price-weighted  index  not  market-cap  weighted.  An  alternative  weighting  besides  market-cap  and  price  is  equal  weighting.  From  Dow  Jones:  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average™.  Introduced  in  May  1896,  the  index,  also      referred  to  as  The  Dow®,  is  a  price-weighted  measure  of  30  U.S.      blue-chip  companies.  Thus,  I  can  wonder  what  in  the  new  shares  makes  the  index  go  up?  If  a  stock  is  split,  the  Dow  divisor  is  adjusted  as  one  could  easily  see  how  the  current  Dow  value  isn't  equal  to  the  sum  or  the  share  prices  of  the  members  of  the  index.  In  other  cases,  there  may  be  a  dilution  of  earnings  but  that  doesn't  necessarily  affect  the  stock  price  directly  as  there  may  be  options  exercised  or  secondary  offerings  made.  SO  if  the  index,  goes  up,  will  the  ETF  DIA  also  go  up  automatically      although  no  additional  buying  has  happened  in  the  ETF  itself?  If  the  index  rises  and  the  ETF  doesn't  proportionally,  then  there  is  an  arbitrage  opportunity  for  someone  to  buy  the  DIA  shares  that  can  be  redeemed  for  the  underlying  stocks  that  are  worth  more  in  this  case.  Look  at  the  Creation  and  Redemption  Unit  process  that  exists  for  ETFs.
65120	Because  in  the  case  for  100/101,  if  you  wanted  to  placed  a  limit  buy  order  at  top  of  the  bid  list  you  would  place  it  at  101  and  get  filled  straight  away.  If  placing  a  limit  buy  order  at  the  top  of  91  (for  90/98)  you  would  not  get  filled  but  just  be  placed  at  the  top  of  the  list.  You  might  get  filled  at  a  lower  price  if  an  ask  comes  in  matching  your  bid,  however  you  might  never  get  filled.  In  regards  to  market  orders,  with  the  100/101  being  more  liquid,  if  your  market  order  is  larger  than  the  orders  at  101,  then  the  remainder  of  your  order  should  still  get  filled  at  only  a  slightly  higher  price.  In  regards  to  market  orders  with  the  90/98,  being  less  liquid,  it  is  likely  that  only  part  of  your  order  gets  filled,  and  any  remained  either  doesn't  get  filled  or  gets  filled  at  a  much  higher  price.
236543	During  a  circuit  breaker,  no  trading  occurs.  These  policies  have  been  implemented  to  maintain  exchange  liquidity  since  the  NYSE  nearly  went  bankrupt  during  the  1987  crash  because  many  members  had  become  insolvent.  If  an  order  is  filled  before  the  halt,  it  will  stand  unless  busted.    During  the  Flash  Crash,  many  orders  were  busted.
5875	quantycuenta  is  right,  if  a  halt  is  in  place,  then  no  trading  will  occur,  simple  as  that.  But  in  the  practice  of  risk  management  it  is  a  little  different.  Want  to  remind  you  that  you  are  assuming  that  trading  is  halted  immediately  upon  the  drop  in  price.  That  doesn't  always  happen,  so  if  there  is  any  time  between  the  actual  price  drop  and  halt  of  trading,  then  it  is  possible  that  your  order  will  be  filled,  depending  on  how  liquid  your  security  is.  Also  not  every  security  has  circuit  breakers  in  place  and  the  exact  requirements  to  trigger  a  breaker  is  not  public  information.    In  some  cases,  trades  are  ordered  to  be  rolled  back  (reversed)  by  the  exchange  but  this  is  usually  reserved  for  institutional  traders  who  make  some  sort  of  mistake.    This  article  below  mentions  day  traders  who  bought  at  or  near  the  bottom  of  the  May  6,  2010  flash  crash.  This  was  before  circuit  breakers  but  I  think  it's  a  good  story  for  someone  looking  to  understand  the  finer  workings  of  the  electronic  market.    http://www.marketwatch.com/story/book-takes-a-look-inside-professional-day-traders-1339513989350
419832	In  theory,  GS  has  a  Chinese  Wall  between  the  department  which  issued  the  advice  and  any  departments  which  may  profit  from  such  advice.  This  would  take  away  some  of  your  distrust,  except  for  the  fact  that  GS  did  violate  these  rules  in  the  past  (see  the  answer  from  user10665).  You're  wondering  about  the  timing,  prior  to  the  release  of  figures  by  Tesla  itself.  This  is  quite  normal.  Predicting  the  past  is  not  that  useful  ;)  The  price  range  indeed  is  wide,  but  that  too  is  a  meaningful  opinion.  It  says  that  GS  thinks  Tesla's  share  price  strongly  depends  on  factors  which  are  hard  to  predict.  In  comparison,  Coca  Cola's  targets  will  be  in  a  much  smaller  range  because  its  costs  and  sales  are  very  stable.
420746	If  there's  indeed  no  reason  to  trust  GS,  i.e.  those  are  just  guides      then  the  question  is:  Why  do  investors  seem  to  care?  Because  there's  a  reason  to  trust.  You're  just  reading  the  bottom  line  -  the  target  price  range.  More  involved  investors  read  the  whole  report,  including  the  description  of  the  current  situation,  the  premises  for  the  analysis,  the  expectations  on  the  firm's  performance  and  what  these  expectations  are  based  on,  the  analysis  of  how  the  various  scenarios  might  affect  the  valuation,  and  the  evaluation  of  chances  of  these  scenarios  to  occur.  You  don't  have  to  trust  everything  and  expect  it  to  be  100%  correct,  analysts  are  not  prophets.  But  you  do  have  an  option  of  reading  their  reports  and  critically  analyzing  their  conclusions.  What  you  suspect  GS  of  doing  ("I  tend  to  believe  those  guys  just  want  themselves  a  cheap  buy  price  a  few  days  before  Q2  earnings  release")  is  a  criminal  offence.
141541	Investment  banks  will  put  out  various  reports  and  collect  revenues  from  that  along  with  their  banking  activity.    I  don't  read  them  or  care  to  read  them  myself.    If  banks  can  make  money  from  something,  they  will  likely  do  it,  especially  if  it  is  legal.  To  take  the  Tesla  stock  question  for  a  moment:  Aren't  you  ruling  out  that  yesterday  was  the  day  that  Tesla  was  included  in  the  Nasdaq  100  and  thus  there  may  be  some  people  today  exiting  because  they  tried  to  cash  in  on  the  index  funds  having  to  buy  the  stock  and  bid  it  up  in  a  sense?    Or  as  @littleadv  points  out  there  could  be  those  tracking  the  stocks  not  in  the  index  that  would  have  been  forced  to  sell  for  another  idea  here.  The  Goldman  note  is  a  possible  explanation  but  there  could  well  be  more  factors  in  play  here  such  as  automated  trading  systems  that  seek  to  take  advantage  of  what  could  be  perceived  as  arbitrage  opportunities.  There  can  be  quick  judgments  made  on  things  which  may  or  may  not  be  true  in  the  end.    After  all,  who  knows  exactly  what  is  causing  the  sell-off.    Is  it  a  bunch  of  stop  orders  being  triggered?    Is  it  people  actually  putting  in  sell  order  manually?    Is  it  something  else?    There  are  lots  of  questions  here  where  I'm  not  sure  how  well  one  can  assign  responsibility  here.
32615	P/E  alone  would  not  work  very  well.  See  for  example  http://www.hussmanfunds.com/html/peak2pk.htm  and  http://www.hussmanfunds.com/rsi/profitmargins.htm  (in  short,  P/E  is  affected  too  much  by  cyclical  changes  in  profit  margins,  or  you  might  say:  booms  inflate  the  E  beyond  sustainable  levels,  thus  making  the  P/E  look  more  favorable  than  it  is).  Here's  a  random  blog  post  that  points  to  Schiller's  normalized  earnings  measure:  http://seekingalpha.com/article/247257-s-p-500-is-expensive-using-normalized-earnings  I  think  even  Price  to  Sales  is  supposed  to  work  better  than  P/E  for  predicting  10-year  returns  on  a  broad  index,  because  it  effectively  normalizes  the  margins.  (Normalized  valuation  explains  the  variance  in  10-year  returns  better  than  the  variance  in  1-year  returns,  I  think  I've  read;  you  can't  rely  on  things  "reverting  to  mean"  in  only  1  year.)  Another  issue  with  P/E  is  that  E  is  more  subject  to  weird  accounting  effects  than  for  example  revenues.  For  example  whether  stock  compensation  is  expensed  or  one-time  write-offs  are  included  or  whatever  can  mean  you  end  up  with  an  economically  strange  earnings  number.  btw,  a  simple  way  to  do  what  you  describe  here  would  be  to  put  a  chunk  of  money  into  funds  that  vary  equity  exposure.  For  example  John  Hussman's  fund  has  an  elaborate  model  that  he  uses  to  decide  when  to  hedge.  Say  you  invest  40%  bonds,  40%  stocks,  and  20%  in  Hussman  Strategic  Growth.  When  Hussman  fully  hedges  his  fund,  you  would  effectively  have  40%  in  stocks;  and  when  he  fully  unhedges  it,  you  would  have  60%  in  stocks.  This  isn't  quite  the  whole  story;  he  also  tries  to  pick  up  some  gains  through  stock  picking,  so  when  fully  hedged  the  fund  isn't  quite  equivalent  to  cash,  more  like  a  market-neutral  fund.  (For  Hussman  Funds  in  particular,  he's  considered  stocks  to  be  overvalued  for  most  of  the  last  15  years,  and  the  fund  is  almost  always  fully  hedged,  so  you'd  want  to  be  comfortable  with  that.)  There  are  other  funds  out  there  doing  similar  stuff.  There  are  certainly  funds  that  vary  equity  exposure  though  most  not  as  dramatically  as  the  Hussman  fund.  Some  possibilities  might  be  PIMCO  All-Asset  All-Authority,  PIMCO  Multi-Asset,  perhaps.  Or  just  some  value-oriented  funds  with  willingness  to  deviate  from  benchmarks.  Definitely  read  the  prospectus  on  all  these  and  research  other  options,  I  just  thought  it  would  be  helpful  to  mention  a  couple  of  specific  examples.  If  you  wanted  to  stick  to  managing  ETFs  yourself,  Morningstar's  premium  service  has  an  interesting  feature  where  they  take  the  by-hand  bottom-up  analysis  of  all  the  stocks  in  an  ETF,  and  use  that  to  calculate  an  over-  or  under-valuation  ratio  for  the  ETF.  I  don't  know  if  the  Morningstar  bottom-up  stuff  necessarily  works;  I'm  sure  they  make  the  "pro"  case  on  their  site.  On  the  "con"  side,  in  the  financial  crisis  bubble  bursting,  they  cut  their  valuation  on  many  companies  and  they  had  a  high  valuation  on  a  lot  of  the  financials  that  blew  up.  While  I  haven't  run  any  stats  and  don't  have  the  data,  in  several  specific  cases  it  looked  like  their  bottom-up  analysis  ended  up  assuming  too-high  profit  margins  would  continue.  Broad-brush  normalized  valuation  measures  avoided  that  mistake  by  ignoring  the  details  of  all  the  individual  companies  and  assuming  the  whole  index  had  to  revert  to  mean.  If  you're  rich,  I  think  you  can  hire  GMO  to  do  a  varied-equity-exposure  strategy  for  you  (http://www.gmo.com/America/).    You  could  also  look  at  the  "fundamental  indexing"  ETFs  that  weight  by  dividends  or  P/E  or  other  measures  of  value,  rather  than  by  market  cap.  The  bottom  line  is,  there  are  lots  of  ways  to  do  tactical  asset  allocation.  It  seems  complex  enough  that  I'm  not  sure  it's  something  you'd  want  to  manage  yourself.  There  are  also  a  lot  of  managers  doing  this  that  I  personally  am  not  comfortable  with  because  they  don't  seem  to  have  a  discipline  or  method  that  they  explain  well  enough,  or  they  don't  seem  to  do  enough  backtesting  and  math,  or  they  rely  on  macroeconomic  forecasts  that  probably  aren't  reliable,  or  whatever.  All  of  these  tactical  allocation  strategies  are  flavors  of  active  management.  I'm  most  comfortable  with  active  management  when  it  has  a  fairly  objective,  testable,  and  logical  discipline  to  it,  such  as  Graham&Buffett  style  value  investing,  Hussman's  statistical  methods,  or  whatever  it  is.    Many  people  will  argue  that  all  active  management  is  bad  and  there's  no  way  to  distinguish  among  any  of  it.  I  am  not  in  that  camp,  but  I  do  think  a  lot  of  active  managers  are  bad,  and  that  it's  pretty  hard  to  distinguish  among  them,  and  I  think  active  management  is  more  likely  to  help  with  risk  control  than  it  is  to  help  with  beating  the  market.  Still  you  should  know  (and  probably  already  do  know,  but  I'll  note  for  other  readers)  that  there's  a  strong  argument  smart  people  make  that  you're  best  off  avoiding  this  whole  line  of  tactical-allocation  thinking  and  just  sticking  to  the  pure  cap-based  index  funds.
132097	P/E  is  a  useful  tool  for  evaluating  the  price  of  a  company,  but  only  in  comparison  to  companies  in  similar  industries,  especially  for  industries  with  well-defined  cash  flows.    For  example,  if  you  compared  Consolidated  Edison  (NYSE:ED)  to  Hawaiian  Electric  (NYSE:HE),  you'll  notice  that  HE  has  a  significantly  higher  PE.  All  things  being  equal,  that  means  that  HE  may  be  overpriced  in  comparison  to  ED.  As  an  investor,  you  need  to  investigate  further  to  determine  whether  that  is  true.  HE  is  unique  in  that  it  is  a  utility  that  also  operates  a  bank,  so  you  need  to  take  that  into  account.  You  need  to  think  about  what  your  goal  is  when  you  say  that  you  are  a  "conservative"  investor  and  look  at  the  big  picture,  not  a  magic  number.  If  conservative  to  you  means  capital  preservation,  you  need  to  ensure  that  you  are  in  investments  that  are  diversified  and  appropriate.  Given  the  interest  rate  situation  in  2011,  that  means  your  bonds  holding  need  to  be  in  short-duration,  high-quality  securities.  Equities  should  be  weighted  towards  large  cap,  with  smaller  holdings  of  international  or  commodity-associated  funds.  Consider  a  target-date  or  blended  fund  like  one  of  the  Vanguard  "Life  Strategy"  funds.
85484	In  the  US,  stocks  are  listed  on  one  exchange  but  can  be  traded  on  multiple  venues.    You  need  to  confirm  exactly  what  your  data  is  showing:  a)  trades  on  the  primary-listed  exchange;  or  b)  trades  made  at  any  venue.  Also,  the  trade  condition  codes  are  important.    Only  certain  trade  condition  codes  contribute  towards  the  day's  open/high/low/close  and  some  others  only  contribute  towards  the  volume  data.    The  Consolidated  Tape  Association  is  very  clear  on  which  trades  should  contribute  towards  each  value  -  but  some  vendors  have  their  own  interpretation  (or  just  simply  an  erroneous  interpretation  of  the  specifications).  It  may  surprise  you  to  find  that  the  majority  of  trading  volume  for  many  stocks  is  not  on  their  primary-listed  exchange.    For  example,  on  2  Mar  2015,  NASDAQ:AAPL  traded  a  total  volume  across  all  venues  was  48096663  shares  but  trading  on  NASDAQ  itself  was  12050277  shares.  Trades  can  be  cancelled.    Some  data  vendors  do  not  modify  their  data  to  reflect  these  busted  trades.      Some  data  vendors  also  "snapshot"  their  feed  at  a  particular  point  in  time  of  the  data.    Some  exchanges  can  provide  data  (mainly  corrections)  4-5  hours  after  the  closing  bell.    By  snapshotting  the  data  too  early  and  throwing  away  any  subsequent  data  is  a  typical  cause  of  data  discrepancies.      Some  data  vendors  also  round  prices/volumes  -  but  stocks  don't  just  trade  to  two  decimal  places.  So  you  may  well  be  comparing  two  different  sets  of  trades  (with  their  own  specific  inclusion  rules)  against  the  same  stock.    You  need  to  confirm  with  your  data  sources  exactly  how  they  do  things.  Disclosure:  Premium  Data  is  an  end-of-day  daily  data  vendor.
193876	of  course  if  you  asked  me  to  give  you  $24.4955  I  can't.  No,  but  if  I  asked  you  to  give  me  $24.4955  and  you  gave  me  a  piece  of  paper  saying  "I  O  U  $24.4955",  and  then  this  happened  repeatedly  until  I  had  collected  100  of  these  pieces  of  paper  from  you,  then  I  could  give  them  back  to  you  in  exchange  for  $2449.55  of  currency.  There's  nothing  magical  about  the  fact  that  there  doesn't  happen  to  be  a  $0.001  coin  in  current  circulation.    This  question  has  some  further  information.
367047	I  recently  bought  a  stock  -    which  was  priced  exactly  as  your  question  ponders,  to  the  1/100  cent.  I  happened  to  buy  2000  shares,  but  just  a  round  lot  of  100  would  be  enough  to  create  no  need  for  rounding.    It's  common  for  industry  to  price  this  way  as  well,  where  an  electronic  component  purchased  by  the  thousands,  is  priced  to  the  tenth  or  hundredth  of  a  cent.    There's  nothing  magic  about  this,  and  you'll  have  more  to  ponder  when  your  own  lowest  unit  of  currency  is  no  longer  minted.  (I  see  you  are  in  UK.  Here,  in  the  US,  there's  talk  of  dropping  our  cent.  A  5  cent  piece  to  be  the  smallest  value  coin.  Yet,  any  non-cash  transactions,  such  as  checks,  credit  card  purchases,  etc,  will  still  price  to  the  penny.)  To  specifically  answer  the  question  -  it's  called  decimal  currency.  1/10,  1/100  of  a  cent.
18440	The  Coinage  Act  of  1792  of  the  Continental  Congress  established  that  the  lowest  money  of  account  for  the  United  States  is  one-thousandth  (1/1000)  of  a  dollar.  This  sub-unit  is  the  mille  (also  written  mil,  mill).  Other  sub-units    given  by  the  act  are  the  disme  for  one-tenth  (1/10)  of  a  dollar  (for  which,  etymologically,  is  the  origin  of  the  word  dime),  and  the  cent  for  one-hundredth  (1/100)  of  a  dollar.  The  ten-thousandth  of  the  dollar  value  is  taken  on  account  by  a  few  financial  organizations,  but  has  no  official  given  term.  For  the  monetary  value  of  USD  27.4955,  it  may  be  quoted  as  twenty-seven  dollars,  forty-nine  cents,  and  five-and-a-half  milles.
227324	They  can  rebalance  and  often  times  at  a  random  manager's  discretion.  ETF's  are  just  funds,  and  funds  all  have  their  own  conditions,  read  the  prospectus,  thats  the  only  source  of  truth.
429827	Can  they  change  the  weights?  Yes.  Will  they?  It  depends.  are  ETF's  fixed  from  their  inception  to  their  de-listing?  It's  actually  not  possible  for  weights  to  be  fixed,  since  different  assets  have  different  returns.  So  the  weights  are  constantly  changing  as  long  as  the  market  is  moving.  Usually  after  a  certain  period  or  a  substantial  market  move,  fund  managers  would  rebalance  and  bring  the  weights  back  to  a  certain  target.  The  target  weights  -  what  your  question  is  really  about  -  aren't  necessarily  the  same  as  the  initial  weights,  but  often  times  they  are.  It  depends  on  the  objective  of  the  ETF  (which  is  stated  in  prospectus).  In  your  example,  if  the  manager  drops  the  weight  of  the  most  volatile  one,  the  returns  of  the  ETF  and  the  5  stocks  could  be  substantially  different  in  the  next  period.  This  is  not  desirable  when  the  ETFs  objective  is  to  track  performance  of  those  5  stocks.    Most  if  not  all  ETFs  are  passively-managed.  The  managers  don't  get  paid  for  active  management.  So  they  don't  have  incentive  to  adjust  the  weights  if  their  funds  are  tracking  the  benchmarks  just  fine.
538580	If  you  plan  to  take  profit  at  $1.00  then  your  profit  will  be  $40.  Then,  if  you  set  your  stop  at  $0.88  then  your  loss  if  you  get  stopped  will  be  $20.    So  your  Reward  :  Risk  =  2:1.    Note,  that  this  does  not  take  into  account  brokerage  in  and  out  and  any  slippage  from  the  price  gapping  past  your  stop  loss.
213938	The  difficulty  is  that  you  are  thinking  of  a  day  as  a  natural  unit  of  time.    For  some  securities  the  inventory  decisions  are  less  than  a  minute,  for  others,  it  can  be  months.    You  could  ask  a  similar  question  of  "why  would  a  dealer  hold  cash?"  They  are  profit  maximizing  firms  and,  subject  to  a  chosen  risk  level,  will  accept  deals  that  are  sufficiently  profitable.    Consider  a  stock  that  averages  1,000  shares  per  day,  but  for  which  there  is  an  order  for  10,000  shares.    At  a  sufficient  discount,  the  dealer  would  be  crazy  not  to  carry  the  order.      You  are  also  assuming  all  orders  are  idiosyncratic.    Dividend  reinvestment  plans  (DRIP)  trigger  planned  purchases  on  a  fixed  day,  usually  by  averaging  them  over  a  period  such  as  10  days.    The  dealer  slowly  accumulates  a  position  leading  up  to  the  date  whenever  it  appears  a  good  discount  is  available  and  fills  the  DRIP  orders  out  of  their  own  account.    The  dealer  tries  to  be  careful  not  to  disturb  the  market  leading  up  to  the  date  and  allows  the  volume  request  to  shift  prices  upward  and  then  fills  them.

345428	I  think  you've  got  competition  on  that  list  for  where  to  put  the  money  -  I'd  work  out  which  option  is  costing  me  the  most  currently  or  will  cost  me  the  most  in  the  future  and  take  care  of  it.  I'd  be  willing  to  bet  that  Eric  is  right,  though,  that  it  will  need  to  be  the  roof.  Not  fixing  it  could  cost  you  more  in  the  long  run  than  any  of  the  other  items  on  the  list  (assuming  your  circumstances  remain  roughly  the  same).    General  comments/other  considerations:  Any  money  that  doesn't  get  spent  on  the  roof  (if  any)  -  I  would  put  in  a  rainy  day  fund.
154829	I've  been  listening  to  Dave  Ramsey  a  lot  lately,  and  he  encourages  (encourage  might  be  too  light  of  a  word  for  him)  this  priority  list  for  budgeting:  I  would  strongly  advise  you  to  tackle  this  list  before  you  start  to  think  about  any  sizable  "fun"  spending.    If  you  don't  have  #1,  set  that  aside  first.  The  options  you  mentioned:  New  roof:  You  should  ask  yourself  "what  is  the  potential  cost  of  not  getting  a  new  roof?"  If  you  can  save  up  for  it  a  little  at  a  time,  while  putting  most  of  the  rest  of  your  money  to  paying  off  debt,  that's  what  I  would  do.    Unless,  of  course,  there  is  damage  or  risk  of  damage  to  your  house  by  not  doing  it  now.  Then,  you  need  to  do  the  same  measurement  (of  doing  the  roof  now)  against  the  goal  of  saving  three  to  six  months  of  expenses.    Especially  in  your  case,  with  your  mortgage  underwater,  you  want  to  be  sure  you  are  prepared  should  anything  happen  (for  example,  losing  a  job,  and  potentially  being  forced  to  move  for  a  new  job).  Cars/student  loan:  (Refer  to  #3  above  —  in  other  words,  yes).
350112	As  much  as  I'd  like  to  tell  you  to  save  some  for  an  emergency  fund  or  use  it  to  pay  off  some  debt,  if  you  really  need  a  new  roof  you  should  get  that  taken  care  of  first.
217424	If  you  need  a  new  roof  because  your  house  is  full  of  buckets  that  fill  up  every  rain  :)  then  that's  most  likely  the  item  at  the  top  of  the  list.  If  you  need  a  new  roof  because  you  don't  like  the  color,  I'd  do  something  else  with  it.  If  you  are  in  the  US  and  the  'education  loan'  has  the  same  caveats  attached  as  your  average  student  loan,  I  would  eye  that  one  with  intent  if  the  roof  can  soldier  on  for  a  few  years  as  is.  The  simple  reason  for  this  is  that  a  student  loan  would  be  the  one  debt  that  you  list  that  you  can  never  get  rid  off  unless  you  actually  pay  it  off,  no  matter  what  happens  (IOW  student  loans  aren't  bankruptable).  Disregard  this  if  the  caveats  in  the  first  sentence  don't  apply...
145383	I  recommend  fixing  the  roof.  You're  going  to  pay  for  it  eventually,  either  as  an  emergency  repair  or  a  concession  at  sale.
90927	Hard  to  give  an  answer  without  knowing  more  details  (interest  rates,  remaining  principle  on  loans,  especially  how  soon  the  new  roof  is  needed).    Maintaining  the  value  in  your  home  (unless  you  are  planning  to  walk  away  from  it  or  short-sell  or  something)  is  of  paramount  importance,  and  the  cost  of  a  leak  should  it  happen  can  be  substantial.  If  the  roof  is  a  few  years  out,  and  you  have  loans  with  interest  rates  about  oh  I'd  say  around  6%or  more  then  I  would  pay  off  those  loans  and  take  the  money  you  were  paying  there  and  start  putting  it  into  a  fund  to  pay  for  the  roof.  I  am  also  a  huge  fan  of  doing  whatever  you  can  to  max  out  your  401K  contributions.    Money  put  into  a  401K  early  has  a  LOT  more  value  than  money  put  in  later,  and  since  you  don't  pay  taxes  on  it,  the  cost  out  of  your  pocket  is  much  lower  (eg.  at  a  20%  tax  rate  it  costs  you  only  $80  out  of  pocket  to  put  $100  into  your  401..  (look  at  that,  you  just  made  like  25%  return  on  that  $80)  Paying  off  loans  is  pretty  much  equivalent  to  making  a  risk  free  return  on  the  money  equal  to  the  interest  rate  on  the  loan.    But  to  REALLY  make  that  work,  what  you  need  to  do  is  in  a  virtual  sense,  keep  making  the  loan  payment  just  now  pay  it  to  yourself,  putting  that  money  into  a  savings  account,  or  towards  your  401K  or  whatever.    If  you  just  torn  around  and  start  spending  that  money,  then  you  are  not  really  getting  as  much  value  to  paying  off  the  loan  early.
535963	Have  you  looked  at  DIY  roof  repair?    Caulking  with  tar  adhesive,  and  shingle  replacement  isn't  that  hard,  if  you're  in  good  health.    Totally  depends  on  how  bad  your  roof  is/what  the  demands  on  it  are  going  to  be.      If  you  can  squeak  another  year  out  of  it,  with  minimal  investment,  you'll  have  a  year's  worth  of,  say  car-debt  (at  what  percent  interest?)  to  put  into  your  roof  fund.
472067	You  are  comparing  apples  and  oranges:  the  charts  show  the  capital  appreciation  excluding  dividends.  If  you  include  dividends  and  calculate  a  total  return  over  that  period  you  see  VSMAX  up  132%  vs.  FSEVX  up  129%,  i.e.  quite  close.  That  residual  difference  is  possibly  due  to  a  performance  difference  between  the  two  benchmarks.
129466	I  wouldn't  only  consider  the  entry/exit  cost  per  trade.  That's  a  good  comparison  page  by  the  way.  I  would  also  consider  the  following.  This  depends  if  you  are  planning  on  using  your  online  broker  to  provide  all  the  information  for  you  to  trade.  I  have  lower  expectations  of  my  online  broker,  not  meant  to  be  harsh  on  the  online  brokers,  but  I  expect  brokers  to  assist  me  in  buying/selling,  not  in  selecting.  Edit:  to  add  to  the  answer  following  a  comment.  Here  are  three  pieces  of  software  to  assist  in  stock  selection
14543	What  you  are  suggesting  would  be  the  correct  strategy,  if  you  knew  exactly  when  the  market  was  going  to  go  back  up.  This  is  called  market  timing.    Since  it  has  been  shown  that  no  one  can  do  this  consistently,  the  best  strategy  is  to  just  keep  your  money  where  it  is.    The  market  tends  to  make  large  jumps,  especially  lately.    Missing  just  a  few  of  these  in  a  year  can  greatly  impact  your  returns.    It  doesn't  really  matter  what  the  market  does  while  you  hold  investments.    The  important  part  is  how  much  you  bought  for  and  how  much  you  sold  for.    This  assumes  that  the  reasons  that  you  selected  those  particular  investments  are  still  valid.    If  this  is  not  the  case,  by  all  means  sell  them  and  pick  something  that  does  meet  your  needs.
145458	If  you  are  investing  for  10  years,  then  you  just  keep  buying  at  whatever  price  the  fund  is  at.  This  is  called  dollar-cost  averaging.  If  the  fund  is  declining  in  value  from  when  you  first  bought  it,  then  when  you  buy  more,  the  AVERAGE  price  you  bought  in  at  is  now  lower.  So  therefore  your  losses  are  lower  AND  when  it  goes  back  up  you  will  make  more.  Even  if  it  continues  to  decline  in  value  then  you  keep  adding  more  money  in  periodically,  eventually  your  position  will  be  so  large  that  on  the  first  uptick  you  will  have  a  huge  percent  gain.  Anyway  this  is  only  suggested  because  you  are  in  it  for  10  years.  Other  people's  investment  goals  vary.
483394	What  might  make  more  sense  is  to  'capture'  your  losses.    Sell  out  the  funds  you  have,  move  into  something  else  that  is  different  enough  that  the  IRS  won't  consider  it  a  wash  sale,  and  you  can  then  use  those  losses  to  offset  gains  (you  can  even  carry  them  forward)      You  would  still  be  in  the  market,  just  having  made  a  sort  of  'sideways  move'.    A  month  or  two  later  (once  you  are  clear  of  wash  sale  rules)  you  could  shift  back  to  your  original  choices.    (this  answer  presumes  you  are  in  the  US,  or  somewhere  that  lets  you  use  losses  to  offset  gains)
210713	No,  you  will  not  have  to  pay  taxes  on  the  corpus  (principal)  of  the  trust  distribution.    If  the  trust  tax  forms  were  filed  correctly,  you  might  have  as  much  as  a  $9000  loss  that  will  flow  to  you  on  the  trust's  termination.    Previously,  the  trust  was  supposed  to  file  a  return  each  year,  and  either  claim  the  dividends  or  realized  cap  gains  each  year,  and  pay  taxes  at  trust's  rate,  or  distribute  them  to  the  beneficiaries  via  K-1  form.  This  is  the  best  way  to  handle  this  as  the  trust  has  a  steep  tax  table  (relative  high  rates)  vs  the  kiddie  tax  which  would  let  you  get  nearly  $1K/yr  tax  free  each  year  as  a  minor.    During  that  time,  losses  net  again  gains,  but  can't  be  'distributed'  to  the  beneficiary.  They  are  carried  forward  year  to  year.  In  the  year  the  trust  is  terminated,  that  loss  is  not  lost,  but  it's  then  passed  on  to  the  beneficiary,  still  via  K-1.  See  Schedule  K-1  instructions  and  Schedule  K-1  itself.    On  a  lighter  note,  the  trustee  failed  you.  In  the  16  years  (Jan  2000-Dec  2015),  the  market  (S&P)  grew  by  88%,  with  a  compound  4.02%/yr  return.  Instead  of  any  gain,  you  got  a  loss  with  a  -2.75%/yr  return.  If  this  were  a  paid  professional,  you'd  have  a  potential  claim  for  a  lawsuit.  This  is  a  reason  why  amateurs  should  not  be  assigned  the  role  of  trustee.    To  clearly  answer  the  mix  of  questions  you  asked  -  Note  -  it's  always  a  good  idea  to  seek  professional  advice.  But,  the  nature  of  this  board  is  that  if  any  of  my  answer  isn't  accurate,  a  high  ranked  member  (top  20  or  so  on  this  list)  will  likely  set  me  straight  within  24  hours.
287156	Both  a  trust  and  an  estate  are  separate,  legal,  taxpaying  entities,  just  like  any  individual.  Income  earned  by  the  trust  or  estate  property  (e.g.,  rents  collected  from  real  estate)  is  income  earned  by  the  trust  or  the  estate.  Who  is  liable  for  taxes  on  income  earned  by  a  trust  depends  on  who  receives  or  retains  benefits  from  the  trust.  Who  is  liable  for  taxes  on  income  received  by  an  estate  depends  on  how  the  income  is  classified  (i.e.,  income  earned  by  the  decedent,  income  earned  by  the  estate,  income  in  respect  of  the  decedent,  or  income  distributed  to  beneficiaries).  Generally,  trusts  and  estates  are  taxed  like  individuals.  General  tax  principles  that  apply  to  individuals  therefore  also  apply  to  trusts  and  estates.  A  trust  or  estate  may  earn  tax−exempt  income  and  may  deduct  certain  expenses.  Each  is  allowed  a  small  exemption  ($300  for  a  simple  trust,  $100  for  a  complex  trust,  $600  for  an  estate).  However,  neither  is  allowed  a  standard  deduction.  The  tax  brackets  for  income  taxable  to  a  trust  or  estate  are  much  more  compressed  and  can  result  in  higher  taxes  than  for  individuals.  In  short,  the  trust  should  have  been  paying  taxes  on  its  gains  all  along,  when  the  money  transfers  to  you  it  will  be  taxed  as  ordinary  income.
193717	You  mention  "early  exercise"  in  your  title,  but  you  seem  to  misunderstand  what  early  exercise  really  means.  Some  companies  offer  stock  options  that  vest  over  a  number  of  years,  but  which  can  be  exercised  before  they  are  vested.  That  is  early  exercise.  You  have  vested  stock  options,  so  early  exercise  is  not  relevant.  (It  may  or  may  not  be  the  case  that  your  stock  options  could  have  been  early  exercised  before  they  vested,  but  regardless,  you  didn't  exercise  them,  so  the  point  is  moot.)  As  littleadv  said,  83(b)  election  is  for  restricted  stocks,  often  from  exercising  unvested  stock  options.  Your  options  are  already  vested,  so  they  won't  be  restricted  stock.  So  83(b)  election  is  not  relevant  for  you.  A  taxable  event  happen  when  you  exercise.  The  point  of  the  83(b)  election  is  that  exercising  unvested  stock  options  is  not  a  taxable  event,  so  83(b)  election  allows  you  to  force  it  to  be  a  taxable  event.  But  for  you,  with  vested  stock  options,  there  is  no  need  to  do  this.  You  mention  that  you  want  it  not  to  be  taxable  upon  exercise.  But  that's  what  Incentive  Stock  Options  (ISOs)  are  for.  ISOs  were  designed  for  the  purpose  of  not  being  taxable  for  regular  income  tax  purposes  when  you  exercise  (although  it  is  still  taxable  upon  exercise  for  AMT  purposes),  and  it  is  only  taxed  when  you  sell.  However,  you  have  Non-qualified  Stock  Options.  Were  you  given  the  option  to  get  ISOs  at  the  beginning?  Why  did  your  company  give  you  NQSOs?  I  don't  know  the  specifics  of  your  situation,  but  since  you  mentioned  "early  exercise"  and  83(b)  elections,  I  have  a  hypothesis  as  to  what  might  have  happened.  For  people  who  early-exercise  (for  plans  that  allow  early-exercise),  there  is  a  slight  advantage  to  having  NQSOs  compared  to  ISOs.  This  is  because  if  you  early  exercise  immediately  upon  grant  and  do  83(b)  election,  you  pay  no  taxes  upon  exercise  (because  the  difference  between  strike  price  and  FMV  is  0),  and  there  are  no  taxes  upon  vesting  (for  regular  or  AMT),  and  if  you  hold  it  for  at  least  1  year,  upon  sale  it  will  be  long-term  capital  gains.  On  the  other  hand,  for  ISOs,  it's  the  same  except  that  for  long-term  capital  gains,  you  have  to  hold  it  2  years  after  grant  and  1  year  after  exercise,  so  the  period  for  long-term  capital  gains  is  longer.  So  companies  that  allow  early  exercise  will  often  offer  employees  either  NQSOs  or  ISOs,  where  you  would  choose  NQSO  if  you  intend  to  early-exercise,  or  ISO  otherwise.  If  (hypothetically)  that's  what  happened,  then  you  chose  wrong  because  you  got  NQSOs  and  didn't  early  exercise.
12034	I  assume  I  can/will  need  to  file  an  83(b)  election,  in  order  to  avoid      tax  repercussions?  What  exactly  will  this  save  me  from?  83(b)  election  is  for  restricted  stock  grants,  not  for  stock  purchases.  For  restricted  stocks,  you  generally  pay  income  tax  when  they  vest.  For  startups  the  price  difference  between  the  time  of  the  grant  and  the  time  of  the  vesting  can  be  astronomical  and  by  choosing  83(b)  you  effectively  pay  income  tax  on  the  value  of  the  grant  instead  of  the  value  of  the  vest.  Then,  you  only  pay  capital  gains  tax  on  the  difference  between  the  sale  price  and  the  grant  value  when  you  sell.  In  your  case  you're  exercising  an  option,  i.e.:  you're  buying  a  stock,  so  83(b)  is  irrelevant.  What  you  will  pay  though  is  the  tax  on  the  difference  between  the  strike  price  and  the  stock  FMV  (unless  the  stocks  you  end  up  buying  are  restricted  -  which  would  have  been  the  case  if  you  exercised  your  options  early,  but  I  don't  think  is  going  to  be  the  case  now).  What  steps  should  I  take  to  (in  the  eyes  of  the  law)  guarantee  that      the  board  has  received  my  execution  notice?  The  secretary  of  the  board      is  a  notorious  procrastinator  and  can  be  very  unorganized.  You  should  read  what  the  grant  contract/company  policy  says  on  that.  Ask  the  HR/manager.  Usually,  a  certified  letter  with  return  receipt  should  be  enough,  but  you  should  verify  the  format,  the  address,  and  the  timeframe.
63971	I'm  not  sure  I  understand  your  question.  If  the  stock  price  is  at  an  all-time  high,  everyone  who  owns  the  stock  is  'in  the  money'.  Of  course,  they  won't  actually  realise  a  capital  gain  until  they  sell  the  stock.  Similarly,  if  the  stock  becomes  worthless  (the  company  shuts  down  after  declaring  bankruptcy,  etc.),  everyone  who  owns  the  stock  is  out  whatever  they  paid  for  the  stock.
392481	The  Owners  of  stock  keep  changing  with  every  Buy  and  Sell.  Hence  its  theoritically  possible  that  everyone  makes  or  loses  money.  Say  the  price  was  $10  when  everyone  purchased  the  stock.  If  the  stock  is  doing  good  and  the  markets  are  good,  the  stock  will  move  up  to  $12.  Everyone  sells  the  stock  to  someone  else.  So  all  the  Old  owners  have  made  $2.  Now  after  some  period  of  time,  the  stock  /  company  is  not  doing  so  well,  and  the  markets  are  bad,  so  the  stock  falls  to  $11,  everyone  sells.  So  all  the  current  owners  make  a  loss  of  $1.      However  in  normal  market  conditions,  there  are  Owners  who  have  purchased  stock  at  different  price  points  and  have  held  it  irrespective  of  whether  the  price  has  gone  above  their  purchase  price  or  below  their  purchase  price.
64213	Take  the  case  where  a  stock  has  just  two  owners,  A  and  B,  both  at  $10.  One  of  them  sells  his  shares  to  C,  at  $11.    Now  B  has  made  $1  in  profit  but  is  no  longer  an  owner  of  the  stock.  A  hasn't  sold  anything  but  his  shares  are  worth  10%  more  due  to  the  last  traded  price  printed.  C  has  bought  shares  at  $11  and  the  price  is  $11,  so  technically  he  hasn't  lost  any  money.  In  a  larger  market,  there  are  winners  and  losers  every  day  on  a  single  stock,  but  they  may  not  remain  owners  of  a  stock.  There  could  be  days  in  which  those  that  remain  owners  are  all  winners  -  say  when  a  stock  goes  up  to  an  all  time  high  and  all  those  that  are  currently  owners  have  an  average  buy  price  lower  than  the  last  traded  price.  And  the  reverse  applies  too.    It  is  of  course  more  complicated.  Say  you  own  a  stock  and  let  someone  else  "borrow"  it  for  a  short-selling  opportunity  (he  sells  it  in  the  market).  For  each  uptick  in  price,  you  win,  the  short  seller  loses,  and  the  guy  he  sold  it  to  also  wins.  A  person  that  has  a  covered  call  on  a  stock  is  not  a  winner  beyond  a  point.  And  so  on.
474384	From  26  CFR  1.1012(c)(1)i):  ...  if  a  taxpayer  sells  or  transfers  shares  of  stock  in  a  corporation  that  the  taxpayer  purchased  or  acquired  on  different  dates  or  at  different  prices  and  the  taxpayer  does  not  adequately  identify  the  lot  from  which  the  stock  is  sold  or  transferred,  the  stock  sold  or  transferred  is  charged  against  the  earliest  lot  the  taxpayer  purchased  or  acquired  to  determine  the  basis  and  holding  period  of  the  stock.  From  26  CFR  1.1012(c)(3):  (i)  Where  the  stock  is  left  in  the  custody  of  a  broker  or  other  agent,  an  adequate  identification  is  made  if—      (a)  At  the  time  of  the  sale  or  transfer,  the  taxpayer  specifies  to  such  broker  or  other  agent  having  custody  of  the  stock  the  particular  stock  to  be  sold  or  transferred,  and  ...  So  if  you  don't  specify,  the  first  share  bought  (for  $100)  is  the  one  sold,  and  you  have  a  capital  gain  of  $800.  But  you  can  specify  to  the  broker  if  you  would  rather  sell  the  stock  bought  later  (and  thus  have  a  lower  gain).  This  can  either  be  done  for  the  individual  sale  (no  later  than  the  settlement  date  of  the  trade),  or  via  standing  order:  26  CFR  1.1012(c)(8)  ...  A  standing  order  or  instruction  for  the  specific  identification  of  stock  is  treated  as  an  adequate  identification  made  at  the  time  of  sale,  transfer,  delivery,  or  distribution.

593045	If  you  don't  want  to  do  the  deep  research  on  each  individual  company,  you  might  want  to  look  at  index  funds  and  similar  "whole  market"  investments.
536345	Stock  recommendations  and  price  history  are  an  unwise  way  to  invest.  People  that  recommend  stocks  are  usually  compensation  for  recommending  it.  They  are  paid  directly  by  third  parties,  that  can  be  paid  in  shares,  they  can  simply  own  the  stock  themselves  and  if  the  stock  goes  up  they  can  sell  it  to  new  investors  at  a  higher  price  (or  even  a  lower  price,  they  may  not  actually  care)  Price  history  does  not  tell  you  a  complete  picture,  what  kind  of  price  history  are  you  even  looking  at:  "this  stock  went  up,  let  me  buy  now  at  the  very  top  and  hope  it  goes  higher,  am  I  too  late"  "this  stock  went  down  let  me  avoid  it"  if  you  don't  know  why,  what,  who,  when,  assets,  debt,  etc,  you  shouldn't  be  buying  the  stock.
561703	I  don't  see  balance  sheet  in  what  you're  looking  at,  and  I'd  definitely  suggest  learning  how  to  read  a  balance  sheet  and  looking  at  it,  if  you're  going  to  buy  stock  in  a  company,  unless  you  know  that  the  recommendations  you're  buying  on  are  already  doing  that  and  you're  willing  to  take  that  risk.    Also,  reading  past  balance  sheets  and  statements  can  give  you  an  idea  about  how  accurate  the  company  is  with  their  predictions,  or  if  they  have  a  history  of  financial  integrity.  Now,  if  you're  going  the  model  portfolio  route,  which  has  become  popular,  the  assumption  that  many  of  these  stock  buyers  are  making  is  that  someone  else  is  doing  that  for  them.    I  am  not  saying  that  this  assumption  is  valid,  just  one  that  I've  seen;  you  will  definitely  find  a  lot  of  skeptics,  and  rightly  so,  about  model  portfolios.    Likewise,  people  who  trade  based  on  what  [Person  X]  does  (like  Warren  Buffett  or  David  Einhorn)  are  assuming  that  they're  doing  the  research.    The  downside  to  this  is  if  you  follow  someone  like  this.    Yeah,  oops.  I  should  also  point  out  that  technical  analysis,  especially  high  probability  TA,  generally  only  looks  at  history.    Most  would  define  it  as  high  risk  and  there  are  many  underlying  assumptions  with  reading  the  price  movements  by  high  probability  TA  types.
238500	What  is  the  best  option  to  start  with?  and    I  am  not  sure  about  my  goals  right  now  but  I  do  want  to  have  a  major  retirement  account  without  changing  it  for  a  long  time  That  is  a  loaded  question.  Your  goals  should  be  set  up  first,  else  what  is  stopping  you  from  playing  the  mega  millions  lottery  to  earn  the  retirement  amount  instantly.  If  you  have  the  time  and  resources,  you  should  try  doing  it  yourself.  It  helps  you  learn  and  at  a  latter  stage  if  you  don't  have  the  time  to  manage  it  yourself,  you  can  find  an  adviser  who  does  it  for  you.  To  find  a  good  adviser  or  find  a  fund  who/which  can  help  you  achieve  your  monetary  goals  you  will  need  to  understand  the  details,  how  it  works  and  other  stuff,  behind  it.    When  you  are  thrown  terms  at  your  face  by  somebody,  you  should  be  able  to  join  the  dots  and  get  a  picture  for  yourself.  Many  a  rich  men  have  lost  their  money  to  unscrupulous  people  i.e.  Bernie  Madoff.  So  knowing  helps  a  lot  and  then  you  can  ask  questions  or  find  for  yourself  to  calm  yourself  i.e.  ditch  the  fund  or  adviser,  when  you  see  red  flags.  It  also  makes  you  not  to  be  too  greedy,  when  somebody  paints  you  a  picture  of  great  returns,  because  then  your  well  oiled  mind  would  start  questioning  the  rationale  behind  such  investments.  Have  a  look  at  Warren  Buffet.  He  is  an  investor  and  you  can  follow  how  he  does  his  investing.  It  is  simple  but  very  difficult  to  follow.  Investing  through  my  bank  I  would  prefer  to  stay  away  from  them,  because  their  main  service  is  banking  and  not  allowing  people  to  trade.  I  would  first  compare  the  services  provided  by  a  bank  to  TD  Ameritrade,  or  any  firm  providing  trading  services.  The  thing  is,  as  you  mentioned  in  the  question,  you  have  to  go  through  a  specific  process  of  calling  him  to  change  your  portfolio,  which  shouldn't  be  a  condition.  What  might  happen  is,  if  he  is  getting  some  benefits  out  of  the  arrangement(get  it  clarified  in  the  first  place  if  you  intend  to  go  through  them),  from  the  side  of  the  fund,  he  might  try  to  dissuade  you  from  doing  so  to  protect  his  stream  of  income.  And  what  if  he  is  on  a  holiday  or  you  cannot  get  hold  of  him.  Secondly  from  your  question,  it  seems  you  aren't  that  investing  literate.  So  it  is  very  easy  to  get  you  confused  by  jargon  and  making  you  do  what  he  gets  the  maximum  benefit  out  of  it,  rather  than  which  benefits  you  more.    I  ain't  saying  he  is  doing  so  but  that  could  be  a  possibility  too,  so  you  have  consider  that  angle  too.  The  pro  is  that  setting  up  an  account  through  them  might  be  much  easier  than  directly  going  to  a  provider.  But  the  best  point  doing  it  yourself  is,  you  will  learn  and  there  is  nothing  which  tops  that.  You  don't  want  somebody  else  managing  your  money,  however  knowledgeable  they  maybe  i.e.  Anthony  Bolton.
244148	Despite  the  fact  that  I  think  there  is  a  litany  of  inaccuracies  and  misunderstandings  related  to  quoted  price  and  transaction  price  and  the  way  prices  move  and  assets  transact;  if  you  were  able  to,  under  these  extremely  narrow  and  very  unlikely  conditions,  affect  the  prices  of  these  assets  that  would  be  market  manipulation  in  the  eyes  of  the  SEC.  Link  to  the  SEC  page  about  market  manipulation.
138703	This  can  be  done,  you  can  be  prosecuted  for  some  forms  of  it,  in  any  case  there  are  more  riskless  ways  of  doing  what  you  suggested.  First,  buying  call  options  from  market  makers  results  in  market  makers  buying  shares  at  the  same  delta  as  the  call  option.  (100  SHARES  X  DELTA  =  How  many  shares  MM's  bought).  You  can  time  this  with  the  volume  and  depth  of  the  shares  market  to  get  a  bigger  resulting  move  caused  by  your  options  purchase  to  get  bigger  quote  changes  in  your  option.  So  on  expiration  day  you  can  be  trade  near  at  the  money  options  back  and  forth  between  being  out  the  money  and  in  the  money.  You  would  exit  the  position  into  liquidity  at  a  profit.  The  risk  here  is  that  you  can  be  sitting  on  a  big  options  position,  where  the  commissions  costs  get  really  big,  but  you  can  spread  this  out  amongst  several  options  contracts.  Second,  you  can  again  take  advantage  of  market  maker  inefficiencies  by  getting  your  primary  position  (whether  in  the  share  market  or  options  market)  placed,  and  then  your  other  position  being  a  very  large  buy  order  a  few  levels  below  the  best  bid.  Many  market  makers  and  algorithms  will  jump  in  front  of  your,  they  think  they  are  being  smart,  but  it  will  raise  the  best  bid  and  likely  make  a  few  higher  prints  for  the  mark,  raising  the  price  of  your  call  option.  And  eventually  remove  your  large  buy  order.  Again,  you  exit  into  liquidity.  This  is  called  spoofing.  There  have  been  some  regulatory  actions  against  people  in  doing  this  in  the  last  few  years.  As  for  consequences,  you  need  to  put  things  into  perspective.  US  capital  market  regulators  have  the  most  nuanced  regulations  and  enforcement  actions  of  worldwide  capital  market  regulators,  and  even  then  they  get  criticized  for  being  unable  or  unwilling  to  curb  these  practices.  With  that  perspective  American  laws  are  basically  a  blueprint  on  what  to  do  in  100  other  country's  stock  exchanges,  where  the  legislature  has  never  gotten  around  to  defining  the  same  laws,  the  securities  regulator  is  even  more  underfunded  and  toothless,  and  the  markets  more  inefficient.  Not  advice,  just  reality.
493010	DCA  is  not  10%/day  over  10  days.  If  I  read  the  objective  correctly,  I'd  suggest  about  a  5  year  plan.  It's  difficult  to  avoid  the  issue  of  market  timing.  And  any  observation  I'd  make  about  the  relative  valuation  of  the  market  would  be  opinion.  By  this  I  mean,  some  are  saying  that  PE/10  which  Nobel  prize  winner  Robert  Schiller  made  well  known,  if  not  popular,  shows  we  are  pretty  high.  Others  are  suggesting  the  current  PE  is  appropriate  given  the  near  zero  rate  of  borrowing.    Your  income  puts  long  term  gains  at  zero  under  current  tax  code.  Short  term  are  at  your  marginal  rate.    I  would  caution  not  to  let  the  tax  tail  wag  the  investing  dog.  The  fellow  that  makes  too  many  buy/sell  decisions  based  on  his  taxes  is  likely  to  lag  he  who  followed  his  overall  allocation  goals.
598478	I  up  voted  JoeTaxpayer  but  i  would  like  add  a  couple  of  things.  Dollar  Cost  averaging  over  a  5  day  period  is  in  no  way  practical.    If  you  get  a  1%  swing  in  that  time  that  would  be  quite  a  lot.  Personally  I  think  5  years  is  way  to  long.    When  markets  go  down  they  go  down  fast.  I  would  suggest  1  to  2  years  investing  quarterly.      I  would  hate  seeing  you  miss  out  on  market  gains  for  a  5  year  period  on  the  last  of  your  money.  The  whole  point  of  Dollar  Cost  averaging  instead  of  market  timing  is  the  mantra  "Its  about  time  in  the  market  not  timing  the  market"    So  if  you  have  money  on  the  sidelines  for  years  you  are  missing  out  on  your  time  in  the  market.
462106	The  product  descriptions  for  FFA  swaps  and  options  can  be  found  here:    http://www.lchclearnet.com/freight/ffas/products.asp  The  index  (e.g.  the  BFA)  is  based  on  the  settlement  prices  of  the  P2,  P2A,  and  C4  contracts  and  the  panamax  TC  routes.    As  such  it's  just  a  performance  index  and  replicates  the  returns  you'd  get  from  holding  a  portfolio  of  the  constituents.  I  think  from  the  clearing  descriptions  everything  should  be  clear.    The  wording  in  the  link  on  the  Baltic  Exchange  website  is  a  bit  nebulous.    I  think  they  mean  standardised  instead  of  specified.    Because  that's  what  sets  the  FFABA  apart  from  OTC  agreements  or  OTC  spot  markets.  Edit:  For  more  information  on  financial  instruments  in  general  see  the  Handbook  of  Financial  Instuments.    I  haven't  got  the  latest  edition  but  I  doubt  he  will  mention  FFAs,  CFSAs,  or  anything  that's  specific  to  maritime  markets  but  after  all  they're  just  plain  forward  agreements  over  a  not-so-common  underlying.
305069	To  answer  this  part  of  the  question:  "How  can  you  build  an  index  based  on  shipping  routes  -  what  is  the  significance  of  that?  Indexes  are  traditionally  built  based  on  companies:  e.g.  S&P  Index  is  a  basket  of  companies  whose  price  varies.  But  here  you  need  a  basket  of  FFA  contracts  from  different  oil  firms  (Shell,  BP),  5  year  Shell  FFA's,  10  year  shell  FFA's.  Where  do  routes  enter  the  picture?  Let  the  tanker  any  route  he  feels  like."  No,  you  don't  get  a  basket  of  FFA  contracts  from  given  companies  (such  as  Shell  and  BP).  What  you  get  are  rates  assessed  by  a  panel  of  brokers  for  the  main  tanker  routes  (especially  in  the  tanker  market,  there  are  comparatively  few  standard  routes,  because  the  major  oil  loading  areas  are  also  comparatively  few).  The  panel  will  assess  the  spot  and  future  markets  on  a  daily  basis,  and  issue  the  rates  accordingly.
357696	For  example,  if  the  Dow,  S&P  500,  NASDAQ  are  all  down  does  that  necessarily  mean  the  Canadian  stock  will  get  negatively  impacted?  Or  is  it  primarily  impacted  by  the  Canadian  market?  The  TWMJF  stock  makes  up  a  very  small  part  of  the  Canadian  market  so  it  affects  the  overall  market,  but  this  doesn't  mean  that  the  overall  market  affects  this  stock.  So  then  the  answer  is:  no,  the  TWMJF  stock  price  will  not  necessarily  follow  either  US  or  Canadian  market  indexes.    However,  there  can  be  major  events  which  can  affect  the  markets,  including  the  stocks  which  make  up  the  markets.  TWMJF  will  probably  be  more  sensitive  to  Canadian  events  than  US  events.
159703	How  you  are  taxed  will  depend  on  what  kind  of  stock  awards  they  are.  The  value  will  be  determined  by  the  company  that  issues  it,  and  appropriate  tax  forms  will  be  sent  to  you  to  include  with  your  taxes.  The  way  the  value  is  determined  is  an  accounting  question  that  is  off-topic  here,  but  the  value  will  be  stated  on  your  stock  award  paperwork.  If  you  are  awarded  the  stock  directly  then  that  value  will  be  taxed  as  ordinary  income.  If  you  are  awarded  options,  then  you  can  purchase  the  stock  to  start  the  clock  on  long-term  capital  gains,  but  you  will  not  incur  any  tax  liability  through  the  initial  purchase.    If  the  company  is  sold  privately  and  you  have  held  the  stock  for  over  1  year,  then  yes,  it  will  be  taxed  as  a  long-term  capital  gain.  If  you  receive/exercise  the  stock  less  than  1  year  before  such  an  acquisition,  then  it  will  be  considered  a  short-term  capital  gain  and  will  be  taxed  as  ordinary  income.
177959	It's  actually  the  other  way  around.    Distributions  in  an  LLC  are  usually  based  on    each  member's  equity  share,  although  the  operating  agreement  can  specify  how  often  such  distributions  are  made.    Shareholders  in  a  corporation  can  receive  dividends,  but  those  are  determined  by  the  corporation's  board  and  can  vary  depending  on  the  class  of  stock  each  shareholder  owns.    Preferred-class  shareholders,  who  may  hold  a  smaller  overall  fraction  of  the  company's  outstanding  shares  than  the  common  stock  shareholders,  may  receive  disproportionately  larger  dividends  per  share  than  common  stock  shareholders,  which  is  one  of  the  (many)  reasons  that  preferred  stock  is  a  better  choice  when  it  is  available.    Take,  for  instance,  what  Berkshire  Class  "A"  shareholders  receive  in  dividends  per  year  compared  to  Class  "B"  shareholders.  Here's  a  good  link  from  LegalZoom  that  can  explain  what  you're  asking  about:  Explanation  of  LLC  distributions  I  hope  this  helps.  Good  luck!
191473	LLC  is  not  a  federal  tax  designation.    It's  a  state-level  organization.  Your  LLC  can  elect  to  be  treated  as  a  partnership,  a  disregarded  entity  (i.e.,  just  report  the  taxes  in  your  individual  income  tax),  or  as  an  S-Corp  for  federal  tax  purposes.  If  you  have  elected  S-Corp,  I  expect  that  all  the  S-Corp  rules  will  apply,  as  well  as  any  state-level  LLC  rules  that  may  apply.      Disclaimer:  I'm  not  100%  familiar  with  S-corp  rules,  so  I  can't  evaluate  whether  the  statements  you  made  about  proportional  payouts  are  correct.
41160	If  we  assume  constant  volatility,  gamma  increases  as  the  stock  gets  closer  to  the  strike  price.  Thus,  delta  is  increasing  at  a  faster  rate  as  the  stock  reaches  closer  to  ITM  because  gamma  is  the  derivative  of  delta.  As  the  stock  gets  deeper  ITM,  the  gamma  will  slow  down  as  delta  reaches  1  or  -1  (depends  if  a  call  or  a  put).  Thus,  the  value  of  the  option  will  change  depending  upon  the  level  of  the  delta.  I  am  ignoring  volatility  and  time  for  this  description.    See  this  diagram  from  Investopedia:  Gamma
231295	The  stock  tends  to  drop  by  the  amount  of  the  dividend  --  or  if  you  prefer  to  think  of  it  this  way,  the  stock  price  has  been  pushed  up  by  the  amount  of  the  dividend  before  it  was  paid  out.  Really,  all  this  shift  does  is  factor  out  the  impending  dividend's  effect  on  the  real  purchase  cost  of  the  stock.  As  such  it's  pretty  much  irrelevant  except  that,  of  course,  the  dividend  is  short-term  gain  that  you  have  to  pay  taxes  on  almost  immediately.  Which  also  tends  to  get  figured  into  the  price  folks  are  willing  to  pay  for  the  stock.  Conclusion:  no,  there's  no  real  opportunity  here.  There's  a  slight  tax  reason  to  avoid  buying  right  before  dividends  are  paid,  but  that's  about  it.  Basic  principle:  If  it's  simple  and  obvious,the  market  has  already  accounted  for  it.
263751	I  guess  the  answer  lies  in  your  tax  jurisdiction  (different  countries  tax  capital  gains  and  income  differently)  and  your  particular  tax  situation.  If  the  price  of  the  stock  goes  up  or  down  between  when  you  buy  and  sell  then  this  counts  for  tax  purposes  as  a  capital  gain  or  loss.  If  you  receive  a  dividend  then  this  counts  as  income.    So,  for  instance,  if  you  pay  tax  on  income  but  not  on  capital  gains  (or  perhaps  at  a  lower  rate  on  capital  gains)  then  it  would  pay  you  to  sell  immediately  before  the  stock  goes  ex-dividend  and  buy  back  immediately  after  thereby  making  a  capital  gain  instead  of  receiving  income.
583080	As  yet  another  explanation  of  why  it  does  not  really  matter,  you  can  look  at  this  from  the  valuation  point  of  view.  Stock  price  is  the  present  value  of  its  future  cash  flows  (be  it  free  cash  flow  of  the  firm  or  dividends,  depending  on  the  model).  Let's  have  a  look  at  the  dividends  case.  Imagine,  the  price  of  the  stock  is  based  on  only  three  dividends  streams  $5  dollars  each:  dividend  to  be  paid  today,  in  year  1,  and  in  year  2.  Each  should  be  discounted  back  to  today  (say,  at  10%),  except  today's  dividend,  since  today  is  now.    Once  that  dividend  is  paid,  it  is  no  longer  in  the  stream  of  cash  flows.  So  if  we  just  delete  that  first  $5  from  the  formula,  the  price  will  adjust  itself  down  by  the  amount  of  the  dividend  to  $8.68.  NOTE  that  this  is  a  very  simple  example,  since  in  reality  cash  flows  streams  are  arguably  infinite  and  because  there  are  many  other  factors  affecting  stock  price.  But  simply  for  your  understanding,  this  example  should  provide  you  with  the  reason  simply  from  the  valuation  perspective.
98704	When  you  hear  advice  to  buy  index  funds,  that  usually  comes  with  two  additional  pieces  of  investment  discipline  advice  that  are  important:  These  two  elements  are  important  to  give  you  relative  predictability  in  your  outcome  20  years  from  now.    In  this  old  blog  post  of  mine  I  linked  to  Warren  Buffett  talking  about  this,  also    mentioned  it  in  a  comment  on  another  answer:  http://blog.ometer.com/2008/03/27/index-funds/  It's  perfectly  plausible  to  do  poorly  over  20  years  if  you  buy  100%  stocks  at  once,  without  dollar-cost  averaging  or  rebalancing.  It's  very  very  very  plausible  to  do  poorly  over  10  years,  such  as  the  last  10  in  fact.  Can  you  really  say  you  know  your  financial  situation  in  20-30  years,  and  for  sure  won't  need  that  money?  Because  predictability  is  important,  I  like  buying  a  balanced  fund  and  not  "pure  stocks":  http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/  (feel  a  little  bad  linking  to  my  blog,  but  retyping  all  that  into  this  answer  seems  dumb!)  Here's  another  tip.  You  can  go  one  step  past  dollar  cost  averaging  and  try  value  averaging:  http://www.amazon.com/Value-Averaging-Strategy-Investment-Classics/dp/0470049774  However,  chances  are  you  aren't  even  going  to  be  good  about  rebalancing  if  it's  done  "by  hand,"  so  personally  I  would  not  do  value  averaging  unless  you  can  find  either  a  fund  or  a  financial  advisor  to  do  it  for  you  automatically.  (Finance  Buff  blog  makes  a  case  for  a  financial  advisor,  in  case  you  like  that  more  than  my  balanced  fund  suggestion:  http://thefinancebuff.com/the-average-investor-should-use-an-investment-advisor-how-to-find-one.html)  Like  rebalancing,  value  averaging  makes  you  buy  more  when  you're  depressed  about  the  market  and  less  when  it's  exciting.  It's  hard.    (Dollar  cost  averaging  is  easily  done  by  setting  up  automatic  investment,  of  course,  so  you  don't  have  to  do  it  manually  in  the  way  you  would  with  value  averaging.)  If  you  read  the  usual  canonical  books  on  index  funds  and  efficient  markets  it's  easy  to  remember  the  takeaway  that  nobody  knows  whether  the  market  will  go  up  or  down,  and  yes  you  won't  successfully  time  the  market.  But  what  you  can  do  successfully  is  use  an  investment  discipline  with  risk  control:  assume  that  the  market  will  fluctuate,  that  both  up  and  down  are  likely  and  possible,  and  optimize  for  predictability  in  light  of  that.  Most  importantly,  optimize  to  take  your  emotions  and  behavior  out  of  the  picture.  Some  disciplines  for  example  are:  there  are  dozens  out  there,  many  of  them  snake  oil,  I  think  these  I  mentioned  are  valid.  Anyway,  you  need  some  form  of  risk  control,  and  putting  all  your  money  in  stocks  at  once  doesn't  give  you  a  lot  of  risk  control.  There's  no  real  need  to  get  creative.  A  balanced  fund  that  uses  index  funds  for  equity  and  bond  portions  is  a  great  choice.
377659	It  would  depend  on  a)  Ones  view  on  Markets  and  b)  Ones  nature.  If  one  believes  that  the  market  would  be  going  up  in  the  near  future  then  it  would  be  best  to  buy  all  at  once.  If  one  believes  the  market  is  uncertain,  it  would  make  sense  to  invest  over  a  period  of  time.  If  one  is  a  disciplined  investor  and  can  stick  to  plan,  it  would  make  sense  to  invest  over  a  period  of  time  as  the  risk  is  generally  less.  How  much  less  is  again  subjective.  If  one  is  not  a  disciplined  investor  then  buying  now  and  getting  done  with  is  a  good  idea.      As  to  exactly  quantifying  this  is  absolute  number  for  future  would  not  be  possible.  One  can  take  the  data  from  past,  however  it  would  work  advantages  if  the  prices  moves  up  and  disadvantages  if  the  price  moves  down.
144349	Depends  on  what  you  are,  an  investor  or  a  speculator.  An  investor  will  look  at  an  'indefinite'  investment  period.  A  speculator  will  be  after  a  fast  buck.  If  you  are  an  investor,  buy  your  stock  once  as  that  will  cost  less  commissions.  After  all,  you'll  sell  your  stock  in  10,  15,  20  years.
533477	Does  the  price  only  start  the  day  based  on  the  previous  day's  rebalancing?  No,  the  tracker  will  open  at  the  price  according  to  the  stock  it  is  tracking.    So  for  example,  if  the  ETF  closed  at  $10  but  the  tracked  stock  continued  trading  and  was  priced  $15  when  the  ETF  reopened  the  ETF  will  open  at  $15.  (Example  is  for  a  non-leveraged  ETF.)
504382	You  don't  need  to  submit  a  K-1  form  to  anyone,  but  you  will  need  to  transcribe  various  entries  on  the  K-1  form  that  you  will  receive  onto  the  appropriate  lines  on  your  tax  return.    Broadly  speaking,  assets  received  as  a  bequest  from  someone  are  not  taxable  income  to  you  but  any  money  that  was  received  by  your  grandmother's  estate  between  the  time  of  death  and  the  time  of  distribution  of  the  assets  (e.g.  interest,  mutual  fund  distributions  paid  in  cash,  etc)  might  be  passed  on  to  you  in  full  instead  of  the  estate  paying  income  tax  on  this  income  and  sending  you  only  the  remainder.  If  so,  this  other  money  would  be  taxable  income  to  you.    The  good  news  is  that  if  the  estate  trust  distributions  include  stock,  your  basis  for  the  stock  is  the  value  as  of  the  date  of  death  (nitpickers:  I  am  aware  that  the  estate  is  allowed  to  pick  a  different  date  for  the  valuation  but  I  am  trying  to  keep  it  simple  here).    That  is,  if  the  stock  has  appreciated,  your  grandmother  never  paid  capital  gains  on  those  unrealized  capital  gains,  and  you  don't  have  to  pay  tax  on  those  capital  gains  either;  your  basis  is  the  appreciated  value  and  if  and  when  you  sell  the  stock,  you  pay  tax  only  on  the  gain,  if  any,  between  the  day  that  Grandma  passed  away  and  the  day  you  sell  the  stock.
330534	For  all  practical  purposes  the  words  mean  the  same  thing.    Shares  are  just  stock  in  a  particular  company  whereas  stock  can  refer  to  shares  over  many  companies.  Investopedia  has  a  good  explaination.  If  you  are  a  financial  journalist  you  might  want  to  make  sure  you  are  using  the  right  term  at  the  right  time,  but  otherwise  they  are  synonyms.
201127	Here's  an  article  on  it  that  might  help:  http://thefinancebuff.com/restricted-stock-units-rsu-sales-and.html  One  of  the  tricky  things  is  that  you  probably  have  the  value  of  the  vested  shares  and  withheld  taxes  already  on  your  W-2.  This  confuses  everyone  including  the  IRS  (they  sent  me  one  of  those  audits-by-mail  one  year,  where  the  issue  was  they  wanted  to  double-count  stock  compensation  that  was  on  both  1099-B  and  W-2;  a  quick  letter  explaining  this  and  they  were  happy).  The  general  idea  is  that  when  you  first  irrevocably  own  the  stock  (it  vests)  then  that's  income,  because  you're  receiving  something  of  value.  So  this  goes  on  a  W-2  and  is  taxed  as  income,  not  capital  gains.  Conceptually  you've  just  spent  however  many  dollars  in  income  to  buy  stock,  so  that's  your  basis  on  the  stock.  For  tax  paid,  if  your  employer  withheld  taxes,  it  should  be  included  in  your  W-2.  In  that  case  you  would  not  separately  list  it  elsewhere.
591385	Your  employer  should  send  you  a  statement  with  this  information.  If  they  didn't,  you  should  still  be  able  to  find  it  through  E*Trade.  Navigate  to:  Trading  &  Portfolios>Portfolios.  Select  the  stock  plan  account.  Under  "Restricted  Stock",  you  should  see  a  list  of  your  grants.  If  you  click  on  the  grant  in  question,  you  should  see  a  breakdown  of  how  many  shares  were  vested  and  released  by  date.  It  will  also  tell  you  the  cost  basis  per  share  and  the  amount  of  taxes  withheld.  You  calculate  your  cost  basis  by  multiplying  the  number  of  released  shares  by  the  cost  basis  per  share.  You  can  ignore  the  ordinary  income  tax  and  taxes  withheld  since  they  will  already  have  been  included  on  your  W2  earnings  and  withholdings.  Really  all  you  need  to  do  is  report  the  capital  gain  or  loss  from  the  cost  basis  (which  if  you  sold  right  away  will  be  rather  small).
110733	You  should  spend  zero  on  your  stock  research  company.    If  the  management  of  the  company  actually  had  persistent  skill  in  picking  stocks,  they  would  not  be  peddling  their  knowledge  to  the  retail  market  for  a  few  hundred  dollars.    They  would  rake  in  millions  and  billions  by  running  a  huge  hedge  fund  and  buy  themselves  a  private  island  or  something.    Unfortunately  for  them,  hedge  fund  investors  are  not  as  gullible  as  retail  investors  and  are  more  likely  to  sue  when  they  discover  they  have  been  lied  to.  Many  stock  "research"  companies  are  trying  to  manipulate  you  into  paying  too  high  a  price  for  stocks.    They  buy  a  small  stock,  recommend  it,  and  then  sell  it  at  the  artificially  (and  temporarily)  high  price.    Others  are  simply  recommending  stocks  pretty  much  at  random.  You  could  do  that  just  as  well  as  they  can,  and  for  free.  Portfolio  performance  evaluation  is  a  complex  problem.    The  research  company  knows  that  its  recommendations  will  "make  good  money"  about  half  the  time  and  that's  enough  to  bring  in  a  lot  of  uninformed  people.    To  know  whether  your  portfolio  actually  did  well  you  need  to  know  how  much  risk  there  was  in  the  portfolio  and  how  a  competing  "dumb"  portfolio  with  similar  characteristics  fared  over  the  same  time  period.    And  you  need  to  repeat  the  experiment  enough  times  (or  long  enough)  to  know  the  outcome  wasn't  luck.    I  can  say  confidently  that  your  portfolio  performance  doesn't  back  up  the  claim  that  the  research  company  has  skill  above  and  beyond  luck.    Much  less  $599  worth  of  skill.  I  can  also  say  very  confidently  that  there  are  no  investors  with  a  total  of  20  thousand  dollars  to  invest  for  whom  purchasing  stock  recommendations  is  worth  the  cost,  even  if  those  recommendations  do  have  some  value.    Real  stock  information  is  valuable  only  to  large  investors  because  the  per-dollar  value  is  low.  Please  do  not  give  money  to  or  otherwise  support  a  semi-criminal  "stock  research"  enterprise.
151437	To  complement  farnsy's  answer,  I  want  to  warn  people  against  market  prediction  scams.  If  they  give  uniformly  distributed  buy/sell  predictions  to  256  people,  one  of  them  will  get  eight  correct  predictions  in  a  row.  They  are  trading  a  few  cents  of  Amazon  server  time  for  3%  of  your  capital.
372360	Yes,  but  only  if  they're  looking  for  investors.  You  would  need  to  contact  them  directly.  Unless  you're  looking  to  invest  a  significant  sum,  they  may  not  be  interested  in  speaking  with  you.  (Think  at  least  6  figures,  maybe  7  depending  on  their  size  and  needs).  This  is  otherwise  known  as  being  a  Venture  Capitalist.  Some  companies  don't  want  additional  investors  because  the  capital  isn't  yet  needed  and  they  don't  want  to  give  up  shares  in  the  profit/control.  Alternatively,  you  could  try  and  figure  out  which  investment  groups  already  have  a  stake  in  the  company  you're  interested  in.  If  those  companies  are  publicly  traded,  you  could  buy  stocks  for  their  company  with  the  expectation  that  their  stock  price  will  increase  if  the  company  you  know  of  does  well  in  the  long  run.
140383	Another  way  to  do  this  is  go  to  work  for  that  company.    Companies  in  this  situation  normally  offer  low  pay,  long  hours,  and  stock  options.    Given  a  sufficient  grant,  it  could  be  all  very  lucrative  or  worthless.      Even  if  you  have  no  electronics  background  you  might  be  able  to  work  in  a  different  capacity.    There  were  secretaries  at  various  companies  that  became  wealthy  off  of  their  stock  options.
280172	The  same  as  when  you  are  buying  a  car.  If  a  dealer  quotes  10k  and  you  quote  8k.  8k  is  the  buy  price  and  10k  is  the  sell  price.    Somebody  might  quote  8.5k  and  another  dealer  might  quote  9.5k.  The  the  new  price  that  you  see  on  your  screen  is  8.5k(Best  buy  price)  and  9.5k(Best  sell  price).  When  the  buyer  and  seller  agree  to  an  amount,  the  car(In  your  case  stock)  is  traded.
87065	The  Bid  price  is  simply  the  highest  buy  price  currently  being  offered  and  the  Ask  price  simply  the  lowest  sell  price  being  offered.  The  list  of  Bid  and  Ask  prices  is  called  the  market  depth.  When  the  Bid  and  Ask  prices  match  then  a  sale  goes  through.  When  looking  to  sell  you  would  generally  look  at  both  the  Bid  and  Ask  prices.  As  a  seller  you  want  to  be  matched  with  the  Bid  price  to  get  a  sale,  but  you  also  need  to  check  the  current  list  of  Ask  prices.  If  the  price  you  want  to  sell  at  is  too  high  you  will  be  placed  down  the  Ask  price  list,  and  unless  the  price  moves  up  to  match  your  sell  price  you  will  not  end  up  selling.  On  the  other-hand,  if  your  price  to  sell  is  too  low  and  in  fact  much  lower  than  the  current  lowest  sell  price  you  may  get  a  quick  sale  but  maybe  at  a  lower  price  than  you  could  have  gotten.  Similarly,  when  looking  to  buy,  you  would  generally  also  look  at  both  the  Bid  and  Ask  prices.  As  a  buyer  you  want  to  be  matched  with  the  Ask  price  to  get  a  sale,  but  you  also  need  to  check  the  current  list  of  Bid  prices.  If  the  price  you  want  to  buy  at  is  too  low  you  will  be  placed  down  the  Bid  price  list,  and  unless  the  price  moves  down  to  match  your  buy  price  you  will  no  end  up  buying.  On  the  other-hand,  if  your  price  to  buy  is  too  high  and  in  fact  much  higher  than  the  current  highest  buy  price  you  may  get  a  quick  purchase  but  maybe  at  a  higher  price  than  you  could  have  gotten.  So,  whether  buying  or  selling,  it  is  important  to  look  at  and  consider  both  the  Bid  and  Ask  prices  in  the  market  depth.
503075	To  add  to  @Victor  's  answer;  if  you  are  entering  a  market  order,  and  not  a  limit  order  (where  you  set  the  price  you  want  to  buy  or  sell  at),  then  the  Ask  price  is  what  you  can  expect  to  pay  to  purchase  shares  of  stock  in  a  long  position  and  the  Bid  price  is  what  you  can  expect  to  receive  when  you  sell  stock  you  own  in  a  long  position.
307155	This  is  copying  my  own  answer  to  another  question,  but  this  is  definitely  relevant  for  you:  A  bid  is  an  offer  to  buy  something  on  an  order  book,  so  for  example  you  may  post  an  offer  to  buy  one  share,  at  $5.  An  ask  is  an  offer  to  sell  something  on  an  order  book,  at  a  set  price.  For  example  you  may  post  an  offer  to  sell  shares  at  $6.  A  trade  happens  when  there  are  bids/asks  that  overlap  each  other,  or  are  at  the  same  price,  so  there  is  always  a  spread  of  at  least  one  of  the  smallest  currency  unit  the  exchange  allows.  Betting  that  the  price  of  an  asset  will  go  down,  traditionally  by  borrowing  some  of  that  asset  and  then  selling  it,  hoping  to  buy  it  back  at  a  lower  price  and  pocket  the  difference  (minus  interest).  Going  long,  as  you  may  have  guessed,  is  the  opposite  of  going  short.  Instead  of  betting  that  the  price  will  go  down,  you  buy  shares  in  the  hope  that  the  price  will  go  up.  So,  let's  say  as  per  your  example  you  borrow  100  shares  of  company  'X',  expecting  the  price  of  them  to  go  down.  You  take  your  shares  to  the  market  and  sell  them  -  you  make  a  market  sell  order  (a  market  'ask').  This  matches  against  a  bid  and  you  receive  a  price  of  $5  per  share.  Now,  let's  pretend  that  you  change  your  mind  and  you  think  the  price  is  going  to  go  up,  you  instantly  regret  your  decision.  In  order  to  pay  back  the  shares,  you  now  need  to  buy  back  your  shares  as  $6  -  which  is  the  price  off  the  ask  offers  on  the  order  book.  Similarly,  the  same  is  true  in  the  reverse  if  you  are  going  long.  Because  of  this  spread,  you  have  lost  money.  You  sold  at  a  low  price  and  bought  at  a  high  price,  meaning  it  costs  you  more  money  to  repay  your  borrowed  shares.  So,  when  you  are  shorting  you  need  the  spread  to  be  as  tight  as  possible.
32811	No.  A  deposit  to  an  IRA  must  be  in  cash.  A  conversion  from  traditional  IRA  to  Roth  can  be  "in  kind"  i.e.  As  a  stock  transfer.  Last,  any  withdrawals  can  also  be  in  stock  or  funds.    IRS  Publication  590,  so  important,  it's  now  in  2  sections  Part  A  and  Part  B,  addresses  IRA  issues  such  as  this  as  well  as  most  others.    By  the  way  -  now  on  page  7  -  "Contributions,  except  for  rollover  contributions,  must  be  in  cash."
399043	Par  value  of  common  stock  is  essentially  a  historical  artifact;  it  is  a  price  at  which  the  company  will  redeem  shares  directly.    If  common  stock  has  any  par  value  at  all,  it  is  always  so  low  that  no  one  would  ever  redeem,  preferring  to  sell  in  the  market  at  a  better  price.    Par  is  obviously  much  more  relevant  to  debt  securities  than  equities.  So  you  do  need  a  strike  price.    ljwobker's  letter  is  a  typical  one,  in  that  companies  often  make  the  strike  price  for  granted  options  a  formula  based  on  the  market  price  of  the  stock  at  the  time  of  the  grant,  say  100%  of  market  or  110%  of  market.    But  you  will  obviously  need  to  find  out  what  strike  your  company  is  offering.
77124	Par  value  SHOULD  mean  that  they  are  offering  you  the  options  with  a  strike  price  (exercise  price)  that  is  equivalent  to  the  current  valuation  of  the  company.    Note  I  said  SHOULD.  As  long  as  you  can  confirm  with  HR  (or  if  you're  small  enough,  just  ask  the  CEO)  that  your  grant  price  is  the  same  as  the  current  valuation  of  the  company's  shares,  then  things  are  straight.    And  while  it's  very  unlikely  that  someone  is  doing  Something  Sneaky,  it's  always  possible.    As  a  reference,  my  recent  grant  letter  said:    [Company]  (the  “Company”)  hereby  grants  you  the  following  Option  to      purchase  shares  of  its  common  stock  (“Shares”).  The  terms  and      conditions  of  this  Option  are  set  forth  in  the  Stock  Option  Agreement      and  the  [Company]  2013  Stock  Incentive  Plan  (the  “Plan”),  both  of      which  are  attached  to  and  made  a  part  of  this  document.
223278	Everyone  that  owns  a  share  of  stock  in  a  company  is  part  owner.  Some  just  own  more  than  others.  According  to  Apple's  latest  proxy  statement  he  owns  5.5  million  shares  of  the  914  million  shares  outstanding.  So  he  owns  approximately  0.6%  of  the  company.    If  he  owned  more  than  50%  of  the  company's  outstanding  stock  he  would  effectively  control  the  board  of  directors  by  being  able  to  pick  whoever  he  wanted.    Then  he  would  control  the  company.  Very  few  publicly  traded  companies  are  that  way.  Most  have  sold  off  parts  of  the  company  to  the  public  in  order  to  raise  cash  for  the  company  and  make  their  investment  more  liquid.
99084	Join  me  for  a  look  at  the  Quote  for  SPY.    A  yield  of  1.82%.  So  over  a  year's  time,  your  $100K  investment  will  give  you  $1820  in  dividends.    The  Top  10  holdings  show  that  Apple  is  now  3%  of  the  S&P.  With  a  current  dividend  of  2.3%.  Every  stock  in  the  S&P  has  its  own  different  dividend.  (Although  the  zeros  are  all  the  same.  Not  every  stock  has  a  dividend.)  The  aggregate  gets  you  to  the  1.82%  current  dividend.  Dividends  are  accumulated  and  paid  out  quarterly,  regardless  of  which  months  the  individual  stocks  pay.
281841	The  amount,  reliability  and  frequency  of  dividends  paid  by  an  ETF  other  than  a  stock,  such  as  an  index  or  mutual  fund,  is  a  function  of  the  agreement  under  which  the  ETF  was  established  by  the  managing  or  issuing  company  (or  companies),  and  the  "basket"  of  investments  that  a  share  in  the  fund  represents.    Let's  say  you  invest  in  a  DJIA-based  index  fund,  for  instance  Dow  Diamonds  (DIA),  which  is  traded  on  several  exchanges  including  NASDAQ  and  AMEX.  One  share  of  this  fund  is  currently  worth  $163.45  (Jan  22  2014  14:11  CDT)  while  the  DJIA  itself  is  $16,381.38  as  of  the  same  time,  so  one  share  of  the  ETF  represents  approximately  1%  of  the  index  it  tracks.  The  ETF  tracks  the  index  by  buying  and  selling  shares  of  the  blue  chips  proportional  to  total  invested  value  of  the  fund,  to  maintain  the  same  weighted  percentages  of  the  same  stocks  that  make  up  the  index.  McDonald's,  for  instance,  has  an  applied  weight  that  makes  the  share  price  of  MCD  stock  roughly  5%  of  the  total  DJIA  value,  and  therefore  roughly  5%  of  the  price  of  100  shares  of  DIA.  Now,  let's  say  MCD  issued  a  dividend  to  shareholders  of,  say,  $.20  per  share.  By  buying  100  shares  of  DIA,  you  own,  through  the  fund,  approximately  five  MCD  shares,  and  would  theoretically  be  entitled  to  $1  in  dividends.  However,  keep  in  mind  that  you  do  not  own  these  shares  directly,  as  you  would  if  you  spent  $16k  buying  the  correct  percentage  of  all  the  shares  directly  off  the  exchange.  You  instead  own  shares  in  the  DIA  fund,  basically  giving  you  an  interest  in  some  investment  bank  that  maintains  a  pool  of  blue-chips  to  back  the  fund  shares.  Whether  the  fund  pays  dividends  or  not  depends  on  the  rules  under  which  that  fund  was  set  up.  The  investment  bank  may  keep  all  the  dividends  itself,  to  cover  the  expenses  inherent  in  managing  the  fund  (paying  fund  management  personnel  and  floor  traders,  covering  losses  versus  the  listed  price  based  on  bid-ask  parity,  etc),  or  it  may  pay  some  percentage  of  total  dividends  received  from  stock  holdings.  However,  it  will  virtually  never  transparently  cut  you  a  check  in  the  amount  of  your  proportional  holding  of  an  indexed  investment  as  if  you  held  those  stocks  directly.  In  the  case  of  the  DIA,  the  fund  pays  dividends  monthly,  at  a  yield  of  2.08%,  virtually  identical  to  the  actual  weighted  DJIA  yield  (2.09%)  but  lower  than  the  per-share  mean  yield  of  the  "DJI  30"  (2.78%).  Differences  between  index  yields  and  ETF  yields  can  be  reflected  in  the  share  price  of  the  ETF  versus  the  actual  index;  100  shares  of  DIA  would  cost  $16,345  versus  the  actual  index  price  of  16,381.38,  a  delta  of  $(36.38)  or  -0.2%  from  the  actual  index  price.  That  difference  can  be  attributed  to  many  things,  but  fundamentally  it's  because  owning  the  DIA  is  not  the  exact  same  thing  as  owning  the  correct  proportion  of  shares  making  up  the  DJIA.  However,  because  of  what  index  funds  represent,  this  difference  is  very  small  because  investors  expect  to  get  the  price  for  the  ETF  that  is  inherent  in  the  real-time  index.
133196	Dividends  are  not  paid  immediately  upon  reception  from  the  companies  owned  by  an  ETF.  In  the  case  of  SPY,  they  have  been  paid  inconsistently  but  now  presumably  quarterly.
139387	A  little  terminology:  Grant:  you  get  a  "gift"  with  strings  attached.  "Grant"  refers  to  the  plan  (legal  contract)  under  which  you  get  the  stock  options.  Vesting:  these  are  the  strings  attached  to  the  grant.  As  long  as  you're  employed  by  the  company,  your  options  will  vest  every  quarter,  proportionally.  You'll  become  an  owner  of  4687  or  4688  options  every  quarter.  Each  such  vest  event  means  you'd  be  getting  an  opportunity  to  buy  the  corresponding  amount  of  stocks  at  the  strike  price  (and  not  the  current  market  price  which  may  be  higher).  Buying  is  called  exercising.  Exercising  a  nonqualified  option  is  a  taxable  event,  and  you'll  be  taxed  on  the  value  of  the  "gift"  you  got.  The  value  is  determined  by  the  difference  between  the  strike  price  (the  price  at  which  you  have  the  option  to  buy  the  stock)  and  the  actual  fair  market  value  of  the  stock  at  the  time  of  vest  (based  on  valuations).  Options  that  are  vested  are  yours  (depending  on  the  grant  contract,  read  it  carefully,  leaving  the  company  may  lead  to  forfeiture).  Options  that  are  not  vested  will  disappear  once  you  leave  the  company.  Exercised  options  become  stocks,  and  are  yours.  Qualified  vs  Nonqualifed  -  refers  to  the  tax  treatment.  Nonqualified  options  don't  have  any  special  treatment,  qualified  do.  3.02M  stocks  issued  refers  to  the  value  of  the  options.  Consider  the  total  valuation  of  the  company  being  $302M.  With  $302M  value  and  3.02M  stocks  issued,  each  stock  is  worth  ~$100.  Now,  in  a  year,  a  new  investor  comes  in,  and  another  3.02M  stocks  are  issued  (if,  for  example,  the  new  investor  wants  a  50%  stake).  In  this  case,  there  will  be  6.04M  stocks  issued,  for  302M  value  -  each  stock  is  worth  $50  now.  That  is  called  dilution.  Your  grant  is  in  nominal  options,  so  in  case  of  dilution,  the  value  of  your  options  will  go  down.  Additional  points:  If  the  company  is  not  yet  public,  selling  the  stocks  may  be  difficult,  and  you  may  own  pieces  of  paper  that  no-one  else  wants  to  buy.  You  will  still  pay  taxes  based  on  the  valuations  and  you  may  end  up  paying  for  these  pieces  of  paper  out  of  your  own  pocket.  In  California,  it  is  illegal  to  not  pay  salary  to  regular  employees.  Unless  you're  a  senior  executive  of  the  company  (which  I  doubt),  you  should  be  paid  at  least  $9/hour  per  the  CA  minimum  wages  law.
56118	Let's  work  from  the  inside  out.  Options  are  not  stock.  Options  are  a  contract  that  give  you  the  right  to  own  the  stock.  For  options  to  have  value  they  have  to  be  exercised.  Straight  line  means  that  each  quarter  1/16th  of  the  option  grant  becomes  yours  and  the  company  cannot  take  it  away.  Four  quarters  in  a  year  times  four  years  is  16  quarters.  'Grant'  means  they  are  giving  you  the  options  at  no  cost  to  you.  'Nonqualified'  means  that  there  is  nothing  you  have  to  do,  or  be,  in  order  to  get  the  options.  (Some  options  are  only  for  management.)
243931	This  has  been  answered  countless  times  before:  One  example  you  may  want  to  look  at  is  DGRO.    It  is  an  iShares  ETF  that  many  discount  brokers  trade  for  free.    This  ETF:    offers  "exposure  to  U.S.  stocks  focused  on  dividend  growth".
25753	How  do  I  start?  (What  broker  do  I  use?)  We  don't  make  specific  recommendations  because  in  a  few    years  that  might  not  be  the  best  recommendation  any  more.  You  are  willing  to  do  your  own  research,  so  here  are  some  things  to  look  for  when  choosing  a  broker:  What  criticism  do  you  have  for  my  plan?  Seeking  dividend  paying  stock  is  a  sensible  way  to  generate  income,  but  share  prices  can  still  be  very  volatile  for  a  conservative  investor.  A  good  strategy  might  be  to  invest  in  several  broad  market  index  and  bond  funds  in  a  specific  allocation  (for  example  you  might  choose  50%  stocks  and  50%  bonds).    Then  as  the  market  moves,  your  stocks  might  increase  by  15%  one  year  while  bonds  stay  relatively  flat,  so  at  the  beginning  of  the  next  year  you  can  sell  some  of  your  stocks  and  buy  bonds  so  that  you  are  back  to  a  50-50  allocation.  The  next  year  there  might  be  a  stock  market  correction,  so  you  sell  some  of  your  bonds  and  buy  stock  until  you  are  back  to  a  50-50  allocation.  This  is  called  rebalancing,  and  it  doesn't  require  you  to  look  at  the  market  daily,  just  on  a  regular  interval  (every  3  months,  6  months,  or  1  year,  whatever  interval  you  are  comfortable  with).  Rebalancing  will  give  you  greater  gains  than  a  static  portfolio,  and  it  can  insulate  you  from  losses  when  the  stock  market  panics  occasionally  if  you  choose  a  conservative  allocation.
495600	Question  1:  How  do  I  start?  or  "the  broker"  problem  Get  an  online  broker.    You  can  do  a  wire  transfer  to  fund  the  account  from  your  bank.  Question  2:  What  criticism  do  you  have  for  my  plan?  Dividend  investing  is  smart.    The  only  problem  is  that  everyone's  currently  doing  it.    There  is  an  insatiable  demand  for  yield,  not  just  individual  investors  but  investment  firms  and  pension  funds  that  need  to  generate  income  to  fund  retirements  for  their  clients.    As  more  investors  purchase  the  shares  of  dividend  paying  securities,  the  share  price  goes  up.    As  the  share  price  goes  up,  the  dividend  yield  goes  down.    Same  for  bonds.    For  example,  if  a  stock  pays  $1  per  year  in  dividends,  and  you  purchase  the  shares  at  $20/each,  then  your  yearly  return  (not  including  share  price  fluctuations)  would  be  1/20  =  5%.    But  if  you  end  up  having  to  pay  $30  per  share,  then  your  yearly  return  would  be  1/30  or  3.3%  yield.    The  more  money  you  invest,  the  bigger  this  difference  becomes;  with  $100K  invested  you'd  make  about  $1.6K  more  at  5%.    (BTW,  don't  put  all  your  money  in  any  small  group  of  stocks,  you  want  to  diversify).    ETFs  work  the  same  way,  where  new  investors  buying  the  shares  cause  the  custodian  to  purchase  more  shares  of  the  underlying  securities,  thus  driving  up  the  price  up  and  yield  down.    Instead  of  ETFs,  I'd  have  a  look  at  something  called  closed  end  funds,  or  CEFs  which  also  hold  an  underlying  basket  of  securities  but  often  trade  at  a  discount  to  their  net  asset  value,  unlike  ETFs.    CEFs  usually  have  higher  yields  than  their  ETF  counterparts.    I  can't  fully  describe  the  ins  and  outs  here  in  this  space,  but  you'll  definately  want  to  do  some  research  on  them  to  better  understand  what  you're  buying,  and  HOW  to  successfully  buy  (ie  make  sure  you're  buying  at  a  historically  steep  discount  to  NAV  [https://seekingalpha.com/article/1116411-the-closed-end-fund-trifecta-how-to-analyze-a-cef]  and  where  to  screen  [https://www.cefconnect.com/closed-end-funds-screener]  Regardless  of  whether  you  decide  to  buy  stocks,  bonds,  ETFs,  CEFs,  sell  puts,  or  some  mix,  the  best  advice  I  can  give  is  to  a)  diversify  (personally,  with  a  single  RARE  exception,  I  never  let  any  one  holding  account  for  more  than  2%  of  my  total  portfolio  value),  and  b)  space  out  your  purchases  over  time.    b)  is  important  because  we've  been  in  a  low  interest  rate  environment  since  about  2009,  and  when  the  risk  free  rate  of  return  is  very  low,  investors  purchase  stocks  and  bonds  which  results  in  lower  yields.    As  the  risk  free  rate  of  return  is  expected  to  finally  start  slowly  rising  in  2017  and  gradually  over  time,  there  should  be  gradual  downward  pressure  (ie  selling)  on  the  prices  of  dividend  stocks  and  especially  bonds  meaning  you'll  get  better  yields  if  you  wait.    Then  again,  we  could  hit  a  recession  and  the  central  banks  actually  lower  rates  which  is  why  I  say  you  want  to  space  your  purchases  out.
161008	This  answer  is  provided  mostly  to  answer  your  question  "what  is  it?"  A  variable  annuity  is  a  contract  between  you  and  an  insurance  company.  The  insurance  company  takes  a  bunch  of  money  up  front  as  a  lump  sum,  and  will  pay  you  some  money  yearly  -  like  earning  interest.  (In  this  case,  they  will  probably  be  paying  you  the  money  into  the  account  itself).  How  much  they  return  is,  as  the  name  suggests,  variable.  It  can  be  anything,  depending  on  what  the  contract  says.  Mostly,  there  will  be  some  formula  based  on  the  stock  market  -  frequently,  the  performance  of  the  Standard  &  Poors  500  Index.  There  will  typically  be  some  minimum  returns  and  maximum  returns  -  if  the  stock  market  tanks,  your  annuity  will  not  lose  a  ton  of  value,  but  if  the  stock  market  goes  up  a  lot  in  one  year  (as  it  frequently  does),  you  will  not  gain  a  lot  of  value  either.  If  you  are  going  to  be  in  the  market  for  a  long  amount  of  time  (decades,  e.g.  "a  few  years  out  of  college"  and  then  a  little),  it  makes  a  lot  more  sense  to  invest  in  the  stock  market  directly.  This  is  essentially  what  the  insurance  company  is  going  to  do,  except  you  can  cut  out  the  middleman.  You  can  get  a  lot  more  money  that  way.  You  are  essentially  paying  the  insurance  company  to  take  on  some  stock  market  risk  for  you  -  you  are  buying  some  safety.  Buying  safety  like  this  is  expensive.    Variable  annuities  are  the  right  investment  for  a  few  people  in  a  few  circumstances  -  mostly,  if  you're  near  retirement,  it's  one  way  to  have  an  option  for  a  "safe"  investment,  for  a  portion  (but  not  all)  of  your  portfolio.  Maybe.  Depending  on  the  specifics,  a  lot.  If  you  are  under,  like,  50  or  so?  Almost  certainly  a  terrible  investment  which  will  gradually  waste  your  money  (by  not  growing  it  as  fast  as  it  deserves  to  be  grown).  Since  you  want  to  transfer  it  to  Vanguard,  you  can  probably  call  Vanguard,  ask  to  open  a  Roth  IRA,  and  request  assistance  rolling  it  over  from  the  place  it  is  held  now.  There  should  be  no  legal  restrictions  or  tax  consequences  from  transferring  the  money  from  one  Roth  IRA  account  to  another.
410542	Your  financial  advisor  got  a  pretty  good  commission  for  selling  you  the  annuity  is  what  happened.  As  for  transferring  it  over  to  Vanguard  (or  any  other  company)  and  investing  it  in  something  else,  go  to  Vanguard's  site,  tell  them  that  you  want  to  open  a  new  Roth  IRA  account  by  doing  a  trustee-to-trustee  transfer  from  your  other  Roth  IRA  account,  and  tell  them  to  go  get  the  funds  for  you  from  your  current  Roth  IRA  trustee.    You  will  need  to  sign  some  papers  authorizing  Vanguard  to  go  fetch,  make  sure  all  the  account  numbers  and  the  name  of  the  current  trustee  (usually  a    company  with  a  name  that  includes  Trust  or  Fiduciary  as  shown  on  your  latest  statement)  are  correct,  and  sit  back  and  wait  while  your  life  improves.
575899	Found  a  great  article  (with  bibliography)  that  covers  taxation  on  investment  activity  by  non  resident  aliens  -  even  covers  the  special  15%  tax  on  dividends  for  Canadian  residents.  It's  (dividend  tax  rate)  generally  30%  for  other  NRAs    (your  2nd  question).  And  it  confirmed  my  suspicion  that  there  are  no  capital  gains  taxes  for  NRAs.  (1st  Q)  Source:  http://invest-faq.com/articles/tax-non-us-nat.html
552138	The  country  from  which  you  purchase  stock  cannot  charge  you  tax  on  either  income  or  capital  gains.  Taxation  is  based  on  residency,  so  even  when  you  purchase  foreign  stock  its  the  tax  laws  of  Malaysia  (as  your  country  of  residence)  that  matter.  At  the  time  of  writing,  Malaysia  does  not  levy  any  capital  gains  tax  and  there  is  no  income  tax  charged  on  dividends  so  you  won't  have  to  declare  or  pay  any  tax  on  your  stocks  regardless  of  where  you  buy  them  from.  The  only  exception  to  this  is  Dividend  Withholding  Tax,  which  is  a  special  tax  taken  by  the  government  of  the  country  you  bought  the  stock  from  before  it  is  paid  to  your  account.  You  do  not  need  to  declare  this  tax  as  it  his  already  been  taken  by  the  time  you  receive  your  dividend.  The  US  withholding  tax  rate  on  dividends  is  30%,  although  this  can  be  reduced  to  15%  if  there  as  a  tax  treaty  in  place  between  the  US  and  your  country  of  residence.  Malaysia  does  have  a  double  taxation  agreement  with  the  US  (see  here:  http://www.mida.gov.my/env3/index.php?page=double-taxation-agreement)  but  it  is  flagged  as  a  "limited"  agreement.    You'd  need  to  find  the  full  text  of  the  agreement  to  see  whether  a  reduced  rate  of  dividend  withholding  tax  would  be  available  in  the  Malaysia/US  treaty.  See  my  other  answer  for  more  details  on  withholding  taxes  and  how  to  partially  reclaim  under  a  double  tax  treaty:  What  is  the  dividend  tax  rate  for  UK  stock  Note:  Although  the  taxation  rules  of  both  countries  are  similar,  I  am  a  resident  of  Singapore  not  Malaysia  so  I  can't  speak  from  first  hand  experience,  but  current  Malaysia  tax  rates  are  easy  to  find  online.  The  rest  of  this  information  is  common  to  any  non-US/UK  resident  investor  (as  long  as  you're  not  a  US  person).
9158	I  believe  that  tax  will  be  withheld  (at  30%?)  on  dividends  paid  to  non-residents.    You  can  claim  it  back  if  your  country  has  a  tax  treaty  with  the  USA,  but  you  will  need  to  file.    You  probably  also  need  to  file  a  W-series  withholding  form  (eg  a  W9-BEN).  Interesting  question.    I  would  like  to  hear  a  more  definitive  answer.
340791	It  appears  that  the  company  in  question  is  raising  money  to  invest  in  expanding  its  operations  (specifically  lithium  production  but  that  is  off  topic  for  here).  The  stock  price  was  rising  on  the  back  of  (perceived)  increases  in  demand  for  the  company's  products  but  in  order  to  fulfil  demand  they  need  to  either  invest  in  higher  production  or  increase  prices.  They  chose  to  increase  production  by  investing.  To  invest  they  needed  to  raise  capital  and  so  are  going  through  the  motions  to  do  that.  The  key  question  as  to  what  will  happen  with  their  stock  price  after  this  is  broken  down  into  two  parts:  short  term  and  long  term:  In  the  short  term  the  price  is  driven  by  the  expectation  of  future  profits  (see  below)  and  the  behavioural  expectations  from  an  increase  in  interest  in  the  stock  caused  by  the  fact  that  it  is  in  the  news.  People  who  had  never  heard  of  the  stock  or  thought  of  investing  in  the  company  have  suddenly  discovered  it  and  been  told  that  it  is  doing  well  and  so  "want  a  piece  of  it".  This  will  exacerbate  the  effect  of  the  news  (broadly  positive  or  negative)  and  will  drive  the  price  in  the  short  run.  The  effect  of  extra  leverage  (assuming  that  they  raise  capital  by  writing  bonds)  also  immediately  increases  the  total  value  of  the  company  so  will  increase  the  price  somewhat.  The  short  term  price  changes  usually  pare  back  after  a  few  months  as  the  shine  goes  off  and  people  take  profits.  For  investing  in  the  long  run  you  need  to  consider  how  the  increase  in  capital  will  be  used  and  how  demand  and  supply  will  change.  Since  the  company  is  using  the  money  to  invest  in  factors  of  production  (i.e.  making  more  product)  it  is  the  return  on  capital  (or  investment)  employed  (ROCE)  that  will  inform  the  fundamentals  underlying  the  stock  price.  The  higher  the  ROCE,  the  more  valuable  the  capital  raised  is  in  the  future  and  the  more  profits  and  the  company  as  a  whole  will  grow.  A  questing  to  ask  yourself  is  whether  they  can  employ  the  extra  capital  at  the  same  ROCE  as  they  currently  produce.  It  is  possible  that  by  investing  in  new,  more  productive  equipment  they  can  raise  their  ROCE  but  also  possible  that,  because  the  lithium  mines  (or  whatever)  can  only  get  so  big  and  can  only  get  so  much  access  to  the  seams  extra  capital  will  not  be  as  productive  as  existing  capital  so  ROCE  will  fall  for  the  new  capital.
496209	Ask  yourself  a  better  question:  Under  my  current  investment  criteria  would  I  buy  the  stock  at  this  price?  If  the  answer  to  that  question  is  yes  you  need  to  work  out  at  what  price  you  would  now  sell  out  of  the  position.  Think  of  these  as  totally  separate  decisions  from  your  original  decisions  to  buy  and  at  what  price  to  sell.  If  you  would  buy  the  stock  now  if  you  didn't  already  hold  a  position  then  you  should  keep  that  position  as  if  you  had  sold  out  at  the  price  that  you  had  originally  seen  as  your  take  profit  level  and  bought  a  new  position  at  the  current  price  without  incurring  the  costs.  If  you  would  not  buy  now  by  those  criteria  then  you  should  sell  out  as  planned.  This  is  essentially  netting  off  two  investing  decisions.  Something  to  think  about  is  that  the  world  has  changed  and  if  you  knew  what  you  know  now  then  you  would  probably  have  set  your  price  limit  higher.  To  be  disciplined  as  an  investor  also  means  reviewing  current  positions  frequently  and  without  any  sympathy  for  past  decisions.
514225	One  of  things  I've  learned  about  trading  on  the  stock  market  is  not  to  let  your  emotions  get  to  you.  Greed  and  fear  are  among  them.  You  may  be  overthinking.  Why  not  keep  it  simple,  if  you  think  it  can  go  up  to  $300  a  share,  put  in  a  stop  loss  at  $X  amount  where  you  would  secure  your  invested  money  along  with  some  gains.  If  it  goes  up,  let  it  go  up,  if  it  doesn't  well  you  got  an  exit.    Then  if  it  goes  up  change  your  stop  loss  amount  higher  if  you  are  feeling  more  optimistic  about  the  stock.    And  by  the  way,  a  disciplined  investor  would  stick  to  their  strategy  but  also  have  the  smarts  to  rethink  it  on  the  fly  such  as  in  a  situation  like  you  are  in.  Just  in  my  opinion  anyway,  but  congrats  on  the  gain!  Some  gains  are  better  than  none.
73256	I  would  expect  that  your  position  will  be  liquidated  when  the  option  expires,  but  not  before.  There's  probably  still  some  time  value  so  it  doesn't  make  sense  for  the  buyer  to  exercise  the  option  early  and  take  your  stock.  Instead  they  could  sell  the  option  to  someone  else  and  collect  the  remaining  time  value.  Occasionally  there's  a  weird  situation  for  whatever  reason,  where  an  option  has  near-zero  or  negative  time  value,  and  then  you  might  get  an  early  exercise.  But  in  general  if  there's  time  value  someone  would  want  to  sell  rather  than  exercise.  If  the  option  hasn't  expired,  maybe  the  stock  will  even  fall  again  and  you'll  keep  it.  If  the  option  just  expired,  maybe  the  exercise  just  hasn't  been  processed  yet,  it  may  take  overnight  or  so.
514922	You  are  NOT  responsible  for  liquidating  the  position.    You  will  either  end  up  retaining  your  100  sh.  after  expiration,  or  they  will  be  called  away  automatically.  You  don't  have  to  do  anything.    Extending  profitability  can  mean  different  things,  but  a  major  consideration  is  whether  or  not  you  want  to  hold  the  stock  or  not.    If  so,  you  can  buy  back  the  in-the-money  call  and  sell  another  one  at-the-money,  or  further  out.  There  are  lots  of  options.
226546	Your  broker  likely  didn't  close  your  position  out  because  it  is  a  covered  position.  Why  interfere  with  a  trade  that  has  no  risk  to  it,  from  their  perspective?  There's  no  risk  for  the  broker  since  your  account  holds  the  shares  available  for  delivery  (definition  of  covered),  for  if  and  when  the  options  you  wrote  (sold)  are  exercised.  And  buyers  of  those  options  will  eventually  exercise  the  options  (by  expiration)  if  they  remain  in-the-money.  There's  only  a  chance  that  an  option  buyer  exercises  prematurely,  and  usually  they  don't  because  there's  often  time  value  left  in  the  option.  That  the  option  buyer  has  an  (ahem)  "option"  to  exercise  is  a  very  key  point.    You  wrote:  "I  fully  expected  my  position  to  be  automatically  liquidated  by  whoever  bought  my  call".  That's  a  false  assumption  about  the  way  options  actually  work.    I  suggest  some  study  of  the  option  exercise  FAQs  here:  Perhaps  if  your  position  were  uncovered  –  i.e.  you  wrote  the  call  without  owning  the  stock  (don't  try  this  at  home,  kids!)  –  and  you  also  had  insufficient  margin  to  cover  such  a  short  position,  then  the  broker  might  have  justifiably  liquidated  your  position.  Whereas,  in  a  covered  call  situation,  there's  really  no  reason  for  them  to  want  to  interfere  –  and  I  would  consider  that  interference,  as  opposed  to  helpful.    The  situation  you've  described  is  neither  risky  for  them,  nor  out  of  the  ordinary.    It  is  (and  should  be)  completely  up  to  you  to  decide  how  to  close  out  the  position.  Anyway,  your  choices  generally  are:
392741	Someone's  (or,  a  bank's)  "exposure  to  equities"  refers  to  the  amount  of  value  which  has  a  risk  that  fluctuates  with  the  equities  market  (ie:  the  stock  market).  In  very  broad  terms,  I  think  it  might  make  sense  to  say  that  exposure  to  equities  could  mean,  for  example,  owning  many  rental  properties,  if  the  rental  market  was  "highly  correlated"  with  the  equities  market.  That  is  -  if  house  prices  go  down  when  the  equities  market  goes  down,  and  if  that  relationship  is  very  strong,  then  owning  a  house  means  you  are  exposed  to  the  equities  market.    However,  in  the  sense  it  is  used  there,  it  seems  to  mean  direct  exposure  to  equities  -  ie:  owning  stocks  and  stock-based  funds.
338754	Yes.  Wash  rules  are  only  for  losses.
14364	Yes,  you  would  have  to  report  the  gain.  It  is  not  relevant  that  you  traded  the  stock  previously,  you  still  made  a  profit  on  the  trade-at-hand.  Imagine  if  for  some  reason  this  type  of  trade  were  exempt.  Investors  could  follow  the  short  term  swings  of  volatile  stocks  completely  tax-free.
285234	I  strongly  doubt  your  numbers,  but  lets  switch  the  question  around  anyway.      Would  you  borrow  10k  on  your  house  to  buy  stocks  on  leverage?    That's  putting  your  house  at  risk  to  have  the  chance  of  a  gain  in  the  stock  market  (and  nothing  in  the  market  is  sure,  especially  in  the  short  term),  and  I  would  really  advise  against  it.    The  decision  you're  considering  making  resolves  down  to  this  one.  Note:  It  is  always  better  to  make  any  additional  checks  out  as  "for  principal  only",  unless  you  will  be  missing  a  future  payment.
368590	what  other  pieces  of  info  should  I  consider  If  you  don't  have  liquid  case  available  for  unexpected  repairs,  then  you  probably  don't  want  to  use  this  money  for  either  option.    The  7%  return  on  the  stocks  is  absolutely  not  guaranteed.  There  is  a  good  amount  of  risk  involved  with  any  stock  investment.  Paying  down  the  mortgage,  by  contrast,  has  a  much  lower  risk.  In  the  case  of  the  mortgage,  you  know  you'll  get  a  2.1%  annual  return  until  it  adjusts,  and  then  you  can  put  some  constraints  on  the  return  you'll  get  after  it  adjusts.  In  the  case  of  stocks,  it's  reasonable  to  guess  that  it  will  return  more  than  2.1%  annually  if  you  hold  it  long  enough.  But  there  will  be  huge  swings  from  month  to  month  and  from  year  to  year.  The  sooner  you  need  it,  the  more  guaranteed  you  will  want  the  return  to  be.  If  you  have  few  or  no  stock  (or  bond)-like  assets,  then  (nearly)  all  of  your  wealth  is  in  your  house,  and  that  is  independent  of  the  remaining  balance  on  your  mortgage.  If  you  are  going  to  sell  the  house  soon,  then  you  will  want  to  diversify  your  assets  to  protect  you  against  a  drop  in  home  value.  If  you  are  going  to  stay  in  the  house  forever,  then  you  will  eventually  need  non-house  assets  to  consume.  Ultimately,  neither  option  is  inherently  better;  it  really  depends  on  what  you  need.
154449	In  all  likelihood,  the  best  thing  you  can  do,  if  these  really  are  your  only  two  options  (ie  no  other  debt  at  all),  paying-down  your  mortgage  will  shorten  the  term  of  the  mortgage,  and  mean  you  spend  less  on  your  house  in  the  long  run.  Investing  is  should  be  a  long-term  activity  -  so  yes,  the  likelihood  is  that,  given  a  modest  investment,  it  will  gain  at  historical  averages  over  the  life  of  the  investment  vehicle.  However,  that  is  not  a  guarantee,  and  is  an  inherent  risk.  Whereas  paying-down  a  mortgage  lowers  your  financial  obligations  and  risk,  investing  increases  your  risk.  I  want  to  know  how  you  got  a  2.1%  interest  rate  on  a  mortgage,  though  -  the  lowest  I've  seen  anywhere  is  3.25%.
209963	The  short  answer  is  to  invest  it  since  the  rate  of  return  is  higher  than  your  mortgage.  (Assuming  that  you  can  withstand  interest  rate  hikes,  meet  short  term  liquidity  needs  and  don't  need  your  $10K  in  the  short  or  near  term).  The  long  answer  is  if  you're  comfortable  leveraging  your  house  and  can  put  that  $10K  away  for  the  long  term  you  can  reduce  your  taxes  via  the  Smith  Manoeuvre:  Alternatively,  if  you  have  kids  or  grandkids  and  will  help  them  through  school,  take  the  government's  money  by  putting  it  away  in  an  RESP.
574820	All  securities  must  be  registered  with  the  SEC.  Securities  are  defined  as  (1)  The  term  “security”  means  any  note,  stock,  treasury  stock,      security  future,  security-based  swap,  bond,  debenture,  evidence  of      indebtedness,  certificate  of  interest  or  participation  in  any      profit-sharing  agreement,  collateral-trust  certificate,      preorganization  certificate  or  subscription,  transferable  share,      investment  contract,  voting-trust  certificate,  certificate  of  deposit      for  a  security,  fractional  undivided  interest  in  oil,  gas,  or  other      mineral  rights,  any  put,  call,  straddle,  option,  or  privilege  on  any      security,  certificate  of  deposit,  or  group  or  index  of  securities      (including  any  interest  therein  or  based  on  the  value  thereof),  or  any      put,  call,  straddle,  option,  or  privilege  entered  into  on  a  national      securities  exchange  relating  to  foreign  currency,  or,  in  general,  any      interest  or  instrument  commonly  known  as  a  “security”,  or  any      certificate  of  interest  or  participation  in,  temporary  or  interim      certificate  for,  receipt  for,  guarantee  of,  or  warrant  or  right  to      subscribe  to  or  purchase,  any  of  the  foregoing.  thus  currencies  are  not  defined  as  securities.  While  OTC  transactions  of  securities  is  not  outright  forbidden,  there  are  numerous  regulations  issued  by  the  SEC  as  a  result  of  the  1943  Exchange  Act  and  others  that  make  this  difficult  and/or  costly.  Many  other  securities  are  exempted  from  registration  thus  trade  in  a  way  that  could  be  called  OTC.  Different  countries  have  variances  upon  US  law  but  are  very  similar.  Any  security  could  be  traded  OTC,  but  law  prohibits  it  expressly  or  in  such  a  way  to  make  it  relatively  expensive;  further,  stock  options  are  so  tightly  regulated  that  expiration  dates,  expiration  intervals,  strike  intervals,  and  minimum  ticks  are  all  set  by  the  authorities.
402216	Generally  if  you  are  using  FIFO  (first  in,  first  out)  accounting,  you  will  need  to  match  the  transactions  based  on  the  number  of  shares.  In  your  example,  at  the  beginning  of  day  6,  you  had  two  lots  of  shares,  100  @  50  and  10  @  52.    On  that  day  you  sold  50  shares,  and  using  FIFO,  you  sold  50  shares  of  the  first  lot.    This  leaves  you  with  50  @  50  and  10  @  52,  and  a  taxable  capital  gain  on  the  50  shares  you  sold.  Note  that  commissions  incurred  buying  the  shares  increase  your  basis,  and  commissions  incurred  selling  the  shares  decrease  your  proceeds.    So  if  you  spent  $10  per  trade,  your  basis  on  the  100  @  50  lot  was  $5010,  and  the  proceeds  on  your  50  @  60  sale  were  $2990.    In  this  example  you  sold  half  of  the  lot,  so  your  basis  for  the  sale  was  half  of  $5010  or  $2505,  so  your  capital  gain  is  $2990  -  2505  =  $485.  The  sales  you  describe  are  also  "wash  sales",  in  that  you  sold  stock  and  bought  back  an  equivalent  stock  within  30  days.    Generally  this  is  only  relevant  if  one  of  the  sales  was  at  a  loss  but  you  will  need  to  account  for  this  in  your  code.    You  can  look  up  the  definition  of  wash  sale,  it  starts  to  get  complex.  If  you  are  writing  code  to  handle  this  in  any  generic  situation  you  will  also  have  to  handle  stock  splits,  spin-offs,  mergers,  etc.  which  change  the  number  of  shares  you  own  and  their  cost  basis.    I  have  implemented  this  myself  and  I  have  written  about  25-30  custom  routines,  one  for  each  kind  of  transaction  that  I've  encountered.    The  structure  of  these  deals  is  limited  only  by  the  imagination  of  investment  bankers  so  I  think  it  is  impossible  to  write  a  single  generic  algorithm  that  handles  them  all,  instead  I  have  a  framework  that  I  update  each  quarter  as  new  transactions  occur.
267627	Yes,  and  there  are  several  ways,  the  safest  is  a  high-yield  savings  account  which  will  return  about  1%  yearly,  so  $35  per  month.  That's  not  extremely  much,  but  better  than  nothing  (you  probably  get  almost  zero  interest  on  a  regular  checking  account).
324946	Is  it  possible  to  profit  from  some  of  this  money  in  the  short  term  before  I  need  to  access  it?  Sure,  it's  possible.    But  if  the  stock  market  decides  to  "correct"  (or  even  crashes),  you'll  be  in  a  world  of  hurt.  Thus,  since  it's  so  important  that  you  not  lose  this  money,  just  stick  it  in  an  online  bank  earning  1.2%,  and  withdraw  "enough"  twice  a  month.  EDIT:  by  "withdraw",  I  mean  to  transfer  to  your  checking  account.
90712	Electronic  trading  is  many  orders  of  magnitude  cheaper  and  more  liquid  than  floor  trading  and  is  rapidly  displacing  it.  Stil,  electronic  trading  accounts  for  79%  of  stock  trading  volume  in  the  U.S.  Polcari  is  losing  the  battle.  Floor  trading  is  still  offered,  but  it's  only  used  for  bulk  orders,  so  electronic  trading  is  servicing  small  trades  at  minimum  prices  while  floor  trading  is  now  the  concierge  service.
359190	I  would  say  it's  a  bit  more  complicated  than  that.  Do  you  understand  what  a  market  maker  does?    An  ECN  (electronic  communication  network)  is  a  virtual  exchange  that  works  with  market  makers.  Using  a  rebate  structure  that  works  by  paying  for  orders  adding  liquidity  and  charges  a  fee  for  removing  liquidity.  So  liquidity  is  created  by  encouraging  what  are  essentially  limit  orders,  orders  that  are  outside  of  the  current  market  price  and  therefore  not  immediately  executable.  These  orders  stay  in  the  book  and  are  filled  when  the  price  of  the  security  moves  and  triggers  them.    So  direct  answer  is  NYSE  ARCA  is  where  market  makers  do  their  jobs.  These  market  makers  can  be  floor  traders  or  algorithmic.  When  you  send  an  order  through  your  brokerage,  your  broker  has  a  number  of  options.  Your  order  can  be  sent  directly  to  an  ECN/exchange  like  NYSE  ARCA,  sent  to  a  market  making  firm  like  KCG  Americas  (formerly  Knight  Capital),  or  internalized.  Internalization  is  when  the  broker  uses  an  in  house  service  to  execute  your  trade.  Brokerages  must  disclose  what  they  do  with  orders.  For  example  etrade's.  https://content.etrade.com/etrade/powerpage/pdf/OrderRouting11AC6.pdf  This  is  a  good  graphic  showing  what  happens  in  general  along  with  the  names  of  some  common  liquidity  providers.  http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-20/how-your-buy-order-gets-filled
297290	There  is  a  lot  of  interesting  information  that  can  be  found  in  a  fund's  prospectus.  I  have  found  it  very  helpful  to  read  books  on  the  issue,  one  I  just  finished  was  "The  Boglehead's  Guide  to  Investing"  which  speaks  mostly  on  mutual  and  index  funds.  Actively  managed  funds  mean  that  someone  is  choosing  which  stocks  to  buy  and  which  to  sell.  If  they  think  a  stock  will  be  "hot"  then  they  buy  it.  Research  has  shown  that  people  cannot  predict  the  stock  market,  which  is  why  many  people  suggest  index  based  funds.  An  index  fund  generally  tracks  a  group  of  companies.  Example:  an  index  fund  of  the  S&P  500  will  try  to  mimic  the  returns  that  the  S&P  500  has.  Overall,  managed  funds  are  more  expensive  than  index  funds  because  the  fund  manager  must  be  paid  to  manage  it.  Also,  there  is  generally  more  buying  and  selling  so  that  also  increases  the  tax  amount  you  would  owe.  What  I  am  planning  on  doing  is  opening  a  Roth  IRA  with  Vanguard,  as  their  funds  have  incredibly  low  fees  (0.2%  on  many).  One  of  the  most  important  things  you  do  before  you  buy  is  to  figure  out  your  target  allocation  (%  of  stocks  vs  %  of  bonds).  Once  you  figure  that  out  then  you  can  start  narrowing  down  the  funds  that  you  wish  to  invest  in.
148019	Technical  Analysis  in  general  is  something  to  be  cognizant  of,  I  don't  use  a  majority  of  studies  and  consider  them  a  waste  of  time.    I  also  use  quantitative  analysis  more  so  than  technical  analysis,  and  prefer  the  insight  it  gives  into  the  market.  The  markets  are  more  about  predicting  other  people's  behavior,  psychology.  So  if  you  are  trading  an  equity  that  you  know  retail  traders  love,  retail  traders  use  technical  analysis  and  you  can  use  their  fabled  channel  reversals  and  support  levels  against  them,  as  examples.  Technical  analysis  is  an  extremely  broad  subject.  So  I  suggest  getting  familiar,  but  if  your  historical  pricing  charts  are  covered  in  various  studies,  I  would  say  you  are  doing  it  wrong.  A  more  objective  criticism  of  technical  analysis  is  that  many  of  the  studies  were  created  in  the  1980s  or  earlier.  Edges  in  the  market  do  not  typically  last  more  than  a  few  weeks.  On  the  other  side  of  that  realization,  some  technical  analysis  works  if  everyone  also  thinks  it  will  work,  if  everyone's  charts  say  buy  when  the  stock  reaches  the  $90  price  level  and  everyone  does,  the  then  stock  will  go  higher.  But  the  market  makers  and  the  actions  of  the  futures  markets  and  the  actions  of  options  traders,  can  undermine  the  collective  decisions  of  retail  traders  using  technical  analysis.
396657	The  study  of  technical  analysis  is  generally  used  (sometimes  successfully)  to  time  the  markets.  There  are  many  aspects  to  technical  analysis,  but  the  simplest  form  is  to  look  for  uptrends  and  downtrends  in  the  charts.    Generally  higher  highs  and  higher  lows  is  considered  an  uptrend.    And  lower  lows  and  lower  highs  is  considered  a  downtrend.    A  trend  follower  would  go  with  the  trend,  for  example  see  a  dip  to  the  trend-line  and  buy  on  the  rebound.  A  simple  strategy  for  this  is  shown  in  the  chart  below:    I  would  be  buying  this  stock  when  the  price  hits  or  gets  very  close  to  the  trendline  and  then  it  bounces  back  above  it.  I  would  then  have  sold  this  stock  once  it  has  broken  through  below  the  trendline.  This  may  also  be  an  appropriate  time  if  you  were  looking  to  short  this  stock.  Other  indicators  could  also  be  used  in  combination  for  additional  confirmation  of  what  is  happening  to  the  price.  Another  type  of  trader  is  called  a  bottom  fisher.  A  bottom  fisher  would  wait  until  a  break  above  the  downtrend  line  (second  chart)  and  buy  after  confirmation  of  a  higher  high  and  possibly  a  higher  low  (as  this  could  be  the  start  of  a  new  uptrend).  There  are  many  more  strategies  dealing  with  the  study  of  technical  analysis,  and  if  you  are  interested  you  would  need  to  find  and  learn  about  ones  that  suit  your  investment  styles,  whether  you  prefer  short  term  trading  or  longer  term  investing,  and  your  appetite  for  risk.  You  can  develop  strategies  using  various  indicators  and  then  paper  trade  or  backtest  these  strategies.  You  can  also  manually  backtest  a  strategy  in  most  charting  packages.  You  can  go  back  in  time  on  the  chart  so  that  the  right  side  of  the  chart  shows  a  date  in  the  past  (say  one  year  ago  or  10  years  ago),  then  you  can  click  forward  one  day  at  a  time  (or  one  week  at  a  time  if  using  weekly  charts).  With  your  indicators  on  the  chart  you  can  do  virtual  trades  to  buy  or  sell  whenever  a  signal  is  given  as  you  move  forward  in  time.  This  way  you  may  be  able  to  check  years  of  data  in  a  day  to  see  if  your  strategy  works.  Whatever  you  do,  you  need  to  document  your  strategies  in  writing  in  a  written  trading  or  investment  plan  together  with  a  risk  management  strategy.  You  should  always  follow  the  rules  in  your  written  plan  to  avoid  you  making  decisions  based  on  emotions.  By  backtesting  or  paper  trading  your  strategies  it  will  give  you  confidence  that  they  will  work  over  the  long  term.    There  is  a  lot  of  work  involved  at  the  start,  but  once  you  have  developed  a  documented  strategy  that  has  been  thoroughly  backtested,  it  will  take  you  minimal  time  to  successfully  manage  your  investments.  In  my  shorter  term  trading  (positions  held  from  a  couple  of  days  to  a  few  weeks)  I  spend  about  half  an  hour  per  night  to  manage  my  trades  and  am  up  about  50%  over  the  last  7  months.  For  my  longer  term  investing  (positions  held  from  months  to  years)  I  spend  about  an  hour  per  week  and  have  been  averaging  over  25%  over  the  last  4  years.  Technical  Analysis  does  work  for  those  who  have  a  documented  plan,  have  approached  it  in  a  systematic  way  and  use  risk  management  to  protect  their  existing  and  future  capital.  Most  people  who  say  that  is  doesn't  work  either  have  not  used  it  themselves  or  have  used  it  ad-hock  without  putting  in  the  initial  time  and  work  to  develop  a  documented  and  systematic  approach  to  their  trading  or  investing.
379311	Now  company  A  has  been  doing  ok  for  couple  of  weeks,  but  then  due  to  some  factors  in  that  company  its  stock  has  been  tanking  heavily  and  doesn't  appear  to  have  a  chance  to  recover.  In  this  kind  of  scenario,  what  does  happen?    In  this  scenario,  if  that  company  is  included  in  the  index  being  tracked,  you  will  continue  holding  until  such  time  that  the  index  is  no  longer  including  that  company.      Index  funds  are  passively  managed  because  they  simply  hold  the  securities  contained  in  the  index  and  seek  to  keep  the  allocations  of  the  fund  in  line  with  the  proportions  of  the  index  being  tracked.    In  an  actively  managed  fund  the  fund  manager  would  try  to  hedge  losses  and  make  stock/security  picks.    If  the  manager  thought  a  particular  company  had  bad  news  coming  maybe  they  would  offload  some  or  all  the  position.    In  an  index  fund,  the  fund  follows  the  index  on  good  days  and  bad  and  the  managers  job  is  to  match  the  asset  allocations  of  the  index,  not  to  pick  stocks.
372355	I'm  assuming  you  mean  4-6%  annually  over  10-15  years.    If  you  mean  4%-6%  total  return  over  10  years  then  this  question  is  easy  just  find  your  local  country's  10Y  bond  and  that  should  likely  cover  it  (though  barely  if  you  are  German).  So  4%-6%  annually  is  not  a  big  stretch  but  it  does  require  some  risk  and  at  least  a  bit  of  work.    A  fire-and-forget  good  mix  would  include  (using  index  mutual  funds  or  etfs)  Some  internet  research  and  a  one-time  meeting  with  a  financial  adviser  who  is  paid  by  you  (not  paid  on  commission)  should  help  you  set  the  right  balance  of  these  index  funds  and  be  a  good  check  on  what  I'm  advising.  If  you  are  willing  to  do  a  tiny  bit  more  work  it's  well  worth  starting  with  a  heavier  weight  on  the  riskier  stocks  and  ex-European  funds  (more  currency  risk)  and  then  every  2-3  years  slowly  move  into  safer  stocks  and  Euro-based  funds.    With  that  tiny  amount  of  extra  work  there  you  can  make  it  much  more  likely  that  you  will  end  within  your  4-6%  range  while  taking  significantly  less  risk  overall.
314972	There  are  multiple  reasons  why  this  may  have  happened:  1.)  I  couldn't  tell  in  your  question  whether  or  not  you  had  already  paid  off  the  loan  before  requesting  the  rollover.  But  if  the  loan  was  defaulted  -  then  the  $9k  left  in  your  account  is  not  distributable,  but  is  there  to  pay  back  the  remaining  balance  on  your  loan.  The  $9k  will  be  treated  as  income,  and  will  be  taxed  -  you  will  receive    a  1099-R  detailing  the  taxes  you'll  owe.  I  don't  know  why  this  wasn't  done  when  they  did  your  rollover  distribution.  Typically  it  all  happens  at  the  same  time  -  but  it  can  vary  depending  on  the  administrator.  2.)  Do  you  get  some  type  of  safe  harbor  discretionary  match,  or  profit  sharing  contribution?  If  so  -  perhaps  this  contribution  was  made  after  your  account  was  liquidated.  So  now  there  is  residual  money  in  your  account  and  it  is  treated  as  a  new  distribution,  which  incurs  a  new  $60  distribution  fee.  3.)  Stock  -  if  some  of  your  investments  were  in  stock  -  these  take  a  few  extra  days  to  liquidate.  Typically  a  TPA/Recordkeeper  would  wait  until  ALL  of  the  funds  are  liquidated  before  issuing  the  rollover.  But  some  companies  may  be  shady  and  do  it  separately  -  incurring  an  additional  $60  distribution  fee.  If  this  was  the  case  -  I  would  go  to  your  former  employer's  HR  and  tell  them  whats  happening  and  to  start  looking  for  a  new  401(k)  administrator!  I  hope  this  helps  :-)  Good  luck!
255277	When  you  leave  an  employer,  401(k)  loans  are  immediately  due  (or  within  30  days  or  60  days).  So  maybe  they  are  waiting  to  see  if  you  will  pay  off  your  loan.  If  you  wanted  to  transfer  the  loan  as  well,  you  need  to  talk  to  your  new  401(k)  plan  administrator  to  find  out  if  this  even  possible.  If  they  say  No  and  you  don't  pay  off  the  loan,  it  will  count  as  a  premature  distribution  from  your  old  401(k)  plan  and  possibly  be  subject  to  excise  tax  in  addition  to  income  tax.
165855	Treasury  stock  is  not  really  represented  in  the  Balance  Sheet  as  a  "Treasury  stock"  line  item  in  the  assets.    Some  companies  will  break  out  Treasury  Shares  as  a  line  item  in  the  "Shareholders  Equity"  heading  of  the  balance  sheet  but  Apple  hides  it  in  the  "Shares  Issued  and  Outstanding"  counts  under  the  "Shareholders  Equity"  heading.    As  of  the  most  recent  Q2  2017  quarterly  report  There  are  5,205,815,000  shares  issued  against  5,336,166,000  shares  outstanding.    This  indicates  that  Apple  is  retaining  about  130,351,000  shares  in  treasury.  On  the  Q1  10-Q  you  can  see  that  Apple  had  5,255,423,000  shares  issued  which  indicates  roughly  49mm  shares  were  repurchased  by  the  end  of  Q2.    You  can  roughly  verify  this  by  looking  at  page  18  of  the  Q2  filing  in  the  summary  of  the  share  repurchase  program.    Repurchased  as  part  of  an  Accelerated  Share  Repurchase  arrangement  bleeds  between  quarters  but  from  February  2017  through  May  2017  there  have  been  17.5mm  shares  repurchased.    31mm  shares  were  also  repurchased  on  the  open  market  in  Q2.        The  "shares  issued"  total  is  on  a  downward  trend  as  part  of  Apple's  share  repurchase  initiative  that  has  been  underway  for  the  last  couple  of  years.
9522	the  pricing  model  makes  all  inverse  leveraged  ETF  decay  over  time.  When  the  price  gets  low  the  manager  can  once  again  do  a  stock  split  to  make  the  share  price  more  attractive.  The  manager  usually  states  a  price  range  that  will  prompt  a  stock  split,  but  actually  doing  the  split  is  at  their  discretion  The  Russell  2000  has  to  decrease  a  lot  yes,  but  probably  just  a  flash  crash  of  10%  in  a  day  can  extend  the  TZA  to  extremely  high  bids  and  asks.  A  flash  crash  that  far  through  the  order  books  would  wreck  the  liquidity  of  all  the  underlying  assets  and  especially  the  derivatives  products  based  on  (derived  from)  those  assets.  So  a  mathematical  formula  to  price  the  ETF  during  a  period  of  high  volatility  and  low  liquidity  becomes  a  lot  less  of  a  science  and  more  of  a  random  walk.  A  good  example  of  this  would  be  to  look  at  the  2010  flash  crash  and  the  price  behavior  of  the  VXZ  ETF,  where  it  spiked  to  $400/share  from  maybe  $60/share
243499	In  a  money  market  fund,  one  share  is  worth  $1.  For  your  fund,  you'll  earn  $0.0010  a  year  per  share,  or  0.10%.    That  is  all  that  you  will  earn.  The  APY  is  just  another  number  to  represent  this  interest  rate,  not  a  separate  income  stream.  If  you  were  expecting  extra  money  from  a  separately  credited  dividend,  you  were  mistaken.  (Usually  the  APY  is  a  slightly  different  number  than  the  interest  rate,  to  reflect  the  way  that  the  interest  is  compounded  over  the  course  of  the  year.  In  this  case  the  compounding  is  too  slight  to  notice  with  just  2  decimal  places.)  If  you  were  investing  in  a  regular  savings  account,  you  would  see  the  rate  you  are  paid  expressed  as  an  APY  also,  but  not  as  a  dividend  (as  no  shares  are  involved)  and  use  that  number  to  compare  the  two.  If  you  were  buying  a  bond  fund  or  stock  fund  that  did  not  have  a  fixed  price,  you  could  calculate  the  dividend  yield  based  on  the  current  stock  price,  but  you  would  not  probably  see  an  APY  listed.  Money  market  funds  are  kind  of  an  odd  hybrid  of  'fund'  and  'savings',  so  they  list  both.
26820	The  dividend  is  what  represents  your  ownership  in  the  CU.    The  APY  is  a  calculated  figure  that  will  help  you  compare  apples  to  apples  the  return  of  the  investment  from  many  vendors  and  many  types.  (I  think  you  CU  might  have  had  two  different  people  writing  that  portion  of  the  website,  because  the  comparisons  pages  don't  make  that  clear,  and  the  pages  don't  layout  the  same  way.)
110114	All  data  for  a  single  adult  in  tax  year  2010.  Roth  IRA    401K  Roth  401k  Traditional  IRA  and  your  employer  offers  a  401k  Traditional  IRA  and  your  employer  does  NOT  offer  a  401k  So,  here  are  your  options.  If  you  have  a  401k  at  work,  you  could  max  that  out.    If  you  make  close  to  $120K,  you  could  reduce  your  AGI  enough  to  contribute  to  a  Roth  IRA.  If  you  do  not  have  a  401k  at  work,  you  could  contribute  to  a  Traditional  IRA  and  deduct  the  $5K  from  your  AGI  similar  to  how  a  401k  works.  Other  than  that,  I  think  you  are  looking  at  investing  outside  of  a  retirement  plan  which  means  more  flexibility,  but  no  tax  advantage.
446226	First  off,  high  five  on  the  paycheck.    There  are  a  few  retirement  issues  to  deal  with.  401k  issues  -  At  that  income  level,  you  will  probably  fall  into  the  "Highly  Compensated  Employee"  category,  which  means  things  get  a  little  more  complicated,  both  for  you  and  your  employer.    (Wikipedia  link)  IRA  issues  -  As  you  already  realized,  you  make  too  much  to  directly  open  and  contribute  to  a  Roth  IRA.    You  can  open  a  Traditional  IRA,  however.    Your  income  is  already  over  the  limit  for  Traditional  IRA  deduction  (bummer),  so  it  would  seem  there  is  little  point  to  opening  an  IRA  at  all.  However,  there  is  a  way  to  take  advantage  of  a  Roth  IRA,  even  at  your  income  level.    It  is  possible  to  convert  a  Traditional  IRA  into  a  Roth  IRA.    There  used  to  be  income  limits  on  the  ability  to  do  the  conversion,  which  would  have  normally  made  this  off  limits  to  you.    Starting  in  2010,  the  income  limit  is  removed,  so  you  can  do  this.  Basically,  you  open  a  Traditional  IRA,  max  it  out,  then  convert  it  to  a  Roth.    Since  there  was  no  income  deduction,  you  shouldn't  have  to  pay  any  more  taxes.    (link)  Disclaimer:  I've  never  tried  this,  nor  do  I  know  anyone  who  has,  so  you  might  want  to  research  it  a  bit  more  before  you  try  it  yourself.
175679	Put  in  the  maximum  you  can  into  the  401(k),  the  limit  should  be  $16,500  so  long  as  the  highly  compensated  rules  don't  kick  in.  Since  you  cannot  deduct  the  traditional  IRA,  it's  a  great  option  to  deposit  to  a  traditional  IRA  and  immediately  convert  that  balance  to  a  Roth  account.  That  puts  you  at  $21,500/yr  saved,  nearly  18%.    There's  nothing  stopping  you  from  investing  outside  these  accounts.  A  nice  ETF  with  low  expenses,  investing  in  a  stock  index  (I  am  thinking  SPY  for  the  S&P  500)  is  great  to  accumulate  long  term.
583200	There  are  three  common  options  for  you:
499827	The  other  alternative:  just  invest  it  in  tax-efficient  investments.  You  will  have  limited  tax-deferral  options  outside  of  your  401k,  but  don't  let  that  limit  you.  You  can  invest  in  a  variety  of  ETFs,  stocks  and  mutual  funds  for  growth,  and  tax-free  investments  like  municipal  bonds  as  you  get  older  and  need  to  draw  income.
1219	You  can  contribute  to  a  Traditional  IRA  instead  of  a  Roth.    The  main  difference  is  a  contribution  to  a  Roth  is  made  with  after  tax  money  but  at  retirement  you  can  withdraw  the  money  tax  free.    With  a  Traditional  IRA  your  contribution  is  tax-deductible  but  at  retirement  the  withdrawal  is  not  tax  free.    This  is  why  most  people  prefer  a  Roth  if  they  can  contribute.  You  can  also  contribute  to  your  work's  401k  plan  assuming  they  have  one.    And  you  can  always  save  for  retirement  in  a  regular  account.
374676	For  example,  if  I  have  an  income  of  $100,000  from  my  job  and  I  also      realize  a  $350,000  in  long-term  capital  gains  from  a  stock  sale,  will      I  pay  20%  on  the  $350K  or  15%?  You'll  pay  20%  assuming  filing  single  and  no  major  offsets  to  taxable  income.  Capital  gains  count  towards  your  income  for  determining  tax  bracket.  They're  on  line  13  of  the  1040  which  is  in  the  "income"  section  and  aren't  adjusted  out/excluded  from  your  taxable  income,  but  since  they  are  taxed  at  a  different  rate  make  sure  to  follow  the  instructions  for  line  44  when  calculating  your  tax  due.
418951	The  $100,000  is  taxed  separately  as  "ordinary  income".  The  $350,000  is  taxed  at  long-term  capital  gains  of  15%.  Capital  gains  is  not  taxed  at  20%  until  $415,050.  Even  though  $100,000  +  350,000  =  $450,000,  only  $350,000  can  be  taxed  at  capital  gains.  The  total  ordinary  income  tax  burden  will  be  $31,986  if  single,  in  California.  Caveat:  By  creating  a  holdings  corporation  (C-corp),  you  can  section  351  that  $100,000  into  the  C-corp  for  tax  deferment,  which  won't  be  taxed  until  you  take  money  from  the  corporation.  Since  you  will  hold  100%  of  the  voting  stock,  all  distributions  will  be  considered  pro  rata.  Additionally,  you  can  issue  yourself  a  dividend  under  the  rules  of  26  USC  §§243-246  (a  greather-than-80%  shareholder  who  receives  a  dividend  can  write-off  100%  of  said  dividend).  As  long  as  that  dividend  doesn't  trigger  §§1.243-246  of  The  Regulations  by  keeping  the  distribution  just  under  10%  of  E&P  i.e.  $10,000.  Wages  are  deductible  against  basis  so  pay  yourself  $35,000  and  keep  $55,000  in  the  corporation  and  you  can  decrease  the  total  liabilities  down  to  $22,000  from  $31,000,  which  includes  the  CA  franchise  tax.  You  don't  have  to  pay  yourself  any  money  out  a  corporation  to  use  the  money.
383896	It's  not  that  straightforward,  even  though  your  gamma  will  change  your  delta  on  the  fly,  you  likely  won't  see  the  full  $.48  after  such  a  small  move.      If  the  vega  drops  due  to  lack  of  volatility  while  the  stock  is  moving  up,  those  few  percentage  points  up  might  help  your  delta  (2%  gain  $50  to  $51  in  your  example)  but  will  be  partially  negated  by  volatility  going  down.  I  mean,  don't  be  surprised  to  see  it  at  closer  to  $1.33  or  something.    The  market  is  out  to  make  money,  not  to  make  you  money.
434625	Here  is  how  I  would  approach  that  problem:  1)  Find  the  average  ratios  of  the  competitors:  2)  Find  the  earnings  and  book  value  per  share  of  Hawaiian  3)  Multiply  the  EPB  and  BVPS  by  the  average  ratios.  Note  that  you  get  two  very  different  numbers.    This  illustrates  why  pricing  from  ratios  is  inexact.    How  you  use  those  answers  to  estimate  a  "price"  is  up  to  you.    You  can  take  the  higher  of  the  two,  the  average,  the  P/E  result  since  you  have  more  data  points,  or  whatever  other  method  you  feel  you  can  justify.      There  is  no  "right"  answer  since  no  one  can  accurately  predict  the  future  price  of  any  stock.
181827	First:  In  most  cases  when  you  inherit  stocks  the  cost  basis  is  stepped  up  to  the  date  of  the  death  of  the  person  you  inherited  them  from.  So  the  capital  gain/loss  is  likely  reset  to  zero.  The  rules  vary  a  bit  for  joint  accounts,  but  retirement  accounts  (401k/ROTH)  are  considered  individual  accounts  by  the  IRS.  The  rules  on  this  have  changed  a  lot  in  recent  history,  so  it  may  depend  on  when  he  died.  Update:  As  JoeTaxpayer  pointed  out  and  I  confirmed  via  this  site  ,  the  gains  are  NOT  stepped  up  for  retirement  accounts,  so  this  is  a  moot  point  anyway.    Further  evidence  that  retirement  accounts  can  be  complicated  and  seeking  professional  guidance  is  a  good  idea.  ...[T]here  is  no  step-up  in  cost  basis      upon  the  death  of  the  IRA  owner.  Most      other  assets  owned  by  an  individual      receive  a  step-up  in  cost  basis  upon      the  death  of  the  person,  eliminating      all  capital  gains  on  those  assets  up      to  that  point  in  time.  Second:    Even  if  you  can  deduct  an  investment  (capital)  loss,  you  can  only  deduct  it  to  offset  capital  gains  on  another  investments.  Also  you  can  only  do  this  up  to  $3k  per  year,  though  you  can  roll  over  excess  capital  losses  into  future  years.  Bottom  line:  I  really  doubt  you  are  going  to  be  able  to  claim  a  deduction.  However,  due  to  the  complexity  of  the  situation  and  the  amount  of  money  involved.  I  strongly  suggest  you  talk  to  a  qualified  tax  adviser  and  not  rely  solely  on  information  you  gather  through  this  site.
15728	I  trust  the  401(k)  was  a  traditional,  pre  tax  account.  There  was  no  tax  paid,  and  any  withdrawals  would  be  taxable.  The  account  could  go  to  zero,  and  there's  no  write  off,  sorry.  I  have  to  ask  -  were  there  any  withdrawals  along  the  way?  What  was  it  invested  in  that  lost  90%  of  its  value?    Edit  -  I'm  sorry  the  OP  came  and  went.  It  would  be  great  to  have  closure  on  some  of  these  issues.  Here,  I'm  thinking  as  Duff  said,  malpractice,  or  perhaps  a  401(k)  that  was  100%  in  company  stock.  Seems  we'll  never  know.
285126	I  may  be  underestimating  your  knowledge  of  how  exchanges  work;  if  so,  I  apologize.    If  not,  then  I  believe  the  answer  is  relatively  straightforward.  Lets  say  price  of  a  stock  at  time  t1  is  15$  .    There  are  many  types  of  price  that  an  exchange  reports  to  the  public  (as  discussed  below);  let's  say  that  you're  referring  to  the  most  recent  trade  price.    That  is,  the  last  time  a  trade  executed  between  a  willing  buyer  and  a  willing  seller  was  at  $15.00.  Lets  say  a  significant  buy  order  of  1M  shares  came  in  to  the  market.  Here  I  believe  might  be  a  misunderstanding  on  your  part.    I  think  you're  assuming  that  the  buy  order  must  necessarily  be  requesting  a  price  of  $15.00  because  that  was  the  last  published  price  at  time  t1.    In  fact,  orders  can  request  any  price  they  want.    It's  totally  okay  for  someone  to  request  to  buy  at  $10.00.    Presumably  nobody  will  want  to  sell  to  him,  but  it's  still  a  perfectly  valid  buy  order.  But  let's  continue  under  the  assumptions  that  at  t1:  This  makes  the  bid  $14.99  and  the  ask  $15.00.    (NYSE  also  publishes  these  prices.)  There  aren't  enough  people  selling  that  stock.  It's  quite  rare  (in  major  US  equities)  for  anyone  to  place  a  buy  order  that  exceeds  the  total  available  shares  listed  for  sale  at  all  prices.    What  I  think  you  mean  is  that  1M  is  larger  than  the  amount  of  currently-listed  sell  requests  at  the  ask  of  $15.00.  So  say  of  the  1M  only  100,000  had  a  matching  sell  order  and  others  are  waiting.  So  this  means  that  there  were  exactly  100,000  shares  waiting  to  be  sold  at  the  ask  of  $15.00,  and  that  all  other  sellers  currently  in  the  market  told  NYSE  they  were  only  willing  to  sell  for  a  price  of  $15.01  or  higher.    If  there  had  been  more  shares  available  at  $15.00,  then  NYSE  would  have  matched  them.  This  would  be  a  trigger  to  the  automated  system  to  start  increasing  the  price.  Here  is  another  point  of  misunderstanding,  I  think.    NYSE's  automated  system  does  not  invent  a  new,  higher  price  to  publish  at  this  point.    Instead  it  simply  reports  the  last  trade  price  (still  $15.00),  and  now  that  all  of  the  willing  sellers  at  $15.00  have  been  matched,  NYSE  also  publishes  the  new  ask  price  of  $15.01.    It's  not  that  NYSE  has  decided  $15.01  is  the  new  price  for  the  stock;  it's  that  $15.01  is  now  the  lowest  price  at  which  anyone  (known  to  NYSE)  is  willing  to  sell.    If  nobody  happened  to  be  interested  in  selling  at  $15.01  at  t1,  but  there  were  people  interested  in  selling  at  $15.02,  then  the  new  published  ask  would  be  $15.02  instead  of  $15.01  --  not  because  NYSE  decided  it,  but  just  because  those  happened  to  be  the  facts  at  the  time.  Similarly,  the  new  bid  is  most  likely  now  $15.00,  assuming  the  person  who  placed  the  order  for  1M  shares  did  not  cancel  the  remaining  unmatched  900,000  shares  of  his/her  order.    That  is,  $15.00  is  now  the  highest  price  at  which  anyone  (known  to  NYSE)  is  willing  to  buy.  How  much  time  does  the  automated  system  wait  to  increment  the  price,  the  frequency  of  the  price  change  and  by  what  percentage  to  increment  etc.  So  I  think  the  answer  to  all  these  questions  is  that  the  automated  system  does  none  of  these  things.    It  merely  publishes  information  about  (a)  the  last  trade  price,  (b)  the  price  that  is  currently  the  lowest  price  at  which  anyone  has  expressed  a  willingness  to  sell,  and  (c)  the  price  that  is  currently  the  highest  price  at  which  anyone  has  expressed  a  willingness  to  buy.  ::edit::  Oh,  I  forgot  to  answer  your  primary  question.  Can  we  estimate  the  impact  of  a  large  buy  order  on  the  share  price?  Not  only  can  we  estimate  the  impact,  but  we  can  know  it  explicitly.    Because  the  exchange  publishes  information  on  all  the  orders  it  knows  about,  anyone  tracking  that  information  can  deduce  that  (in  this  example)  there  were  exactly  100,000  shares  waiting  to  be  purchased  at  $15.00.    So  if  a  "large  buy  order"  of  1M  shares  comes  in  at  $15.00,  then  we  know  that  all  of  the  people  waiting  to  sell  at  $15.00  will  be  matched,  and  the  new  lowest  ask  price  will  be  $15.01  (or  whatever  was  the  next  lowest  sell  price  that  the  exchange  had  previously  published).
525231	There  are  two  distinct  questions  that  may  be  of  interest  to  you.  Both  questions  are  relevant  for  funds  that  need  to  buy  or  sell  large  orders  that  you  are  talking  about.  The  answer  depends  on  your  order  type  and  the  current  market  state  such  as  the  level  2  order  book.  Suppose  there  are  no  iceberg  or  hidden  orders  and  the  order  book  (image  courtesy  of  this  question)  currently  is:    An  unlimited  ("at  market")  buy  order  for  12,000  shares  gets  filled  immediately:  it  gets  1,100  shares  at  180.03  (1,100@180.03),  9,700  at  180.04  and  1,200  at  180.05.  After  this  order,  the  lowest  ask  price  becomes  180.05  and  the  highest  bid  is  obviously  still  180.02  (because  the  previous  order  was  a  'market  order').  A  limited  buy  order  for  12,000  shares  with  a  price  limit  of  180.04  gets  the  first  two  fills  just  like  the  market  order:  1,100  shares  at  180.03  and  9,700  at  180.04.  However,  the  remainder  of  the  order  will  establish  a  new  bid  price  level  for  1,200  shares  at  180.04.  It  is  possible  to  enter  an  unlimited  buy  order  that  exhausts  the  book.  However,  such  a  trade  would  often  be  considered  a  mis-trade  and  either  (i)  be  cancelled  by  the  broker,  (ii)  be  cancelled  or  undone  by  the  exchange,  or  (iii)  hit  the  maximum  price  move  a  stock  is  allowed  per  day  ("limit  up").  Funds  and  banks  often  have  to  buy  or  sell  large  quantities,  just  like  you  have  described.  However  they  usually  do  not  punch  through  order  book  levels  as  I  described  before.  Instead  they  would  spread  out  the  order  over  time  and  buy  a  smaller  quantity  several  times  throughout  the  day.  Simple  algorithms  attempt  to  get  a  price  close  to  the  time-weighted  average  price  (TWAP)  or  volume-weighted  average  price  (VWAP)  and  would  buy  a  smaller  amount  every  N  minutes.  Despite  splitting  the  order  into  smaller  pieces  the  price  usually  moves  against  the  trader  for  many  reasons.  There  are  many  models  to  estimate  the  market  impact  of  an  order  before  executing  it  and  many  brokers  have  their  own  model,  for  example  Deutsche  Bank.  There  is  considerable  research  on  "market  impact"  if  you  are  interested.  I  understand  the  general  principal  that  when  significant  buy  orders      comes  in  relative  to  the  sell  orders  price  goes  up  and  when  a      significant  sell  order  comes  in  relative  to  buy  orders  it  goes  down.  I  consider  this  statement  wrong  or  at  least  misleading.  First,  stocks  can  jump  in  price  without  or  with  very  little  volume.  Consider  a  company  that  releases  a  negative  earnings  surprise  over  night.  On  the  next  day  the  stock  may  open  20%  lower  without  any  orders  having  matched  for  any  price  in  between.  The  price  moved  because  the  perception  of  the  stocks  value  changed,  not  because  of  buy  or  sell  pressure.  Second,  buy  and  sell  pressure  have  an  effect  on  the  price  because  of  the  underlying  reason,  and  not  necessarily/only  because  of  the  mechanics  of  the  market.  Assume  you  were  prepared  to  sell  HyperNanoTech  stock,  but  suddenly  there's  a  lot  of  buzz  and  your  colleagues  are  talking  about  buying  it.  Would  you  still  sell  it  for  the  same  price?  I  wouldn't.  I  would  try  to  find  out  how  much  they  are  prepared  to  buy  it  for.  In  other  words,  buy  pressure  can  be  the  consequence  of  successful  marketing  of  the  stock  and  the  marketing  buzz  is  what  changes  the  price.
67069	If  you  look  at  a  trade  grid  you  can  see  how  this  happens.  If  there  are  enough  bids  to  cover  all  shares  currently  on  the  sell  side  at  a  certain  price,  those  shares  will  be  bought  and  increased  price  quotes  will  be  shown  for  the  bids  and  ask.  If  there  are  enough  bids  to  cover  this  price,  those  will  get  bought  and  higher  prices  will  be  shown  and  this  process  will  repeat  until  the  sell  side  has  more  power  than  the  buy  side.  It  seems  like  this  process  is  going  on  all  day  long  with  momentum  either  on  the  upside  or  downside.  But  I  think  that  much  of  this  bidding  and  selling  is  automatic  and  is  being  done  by  large  trading  firms  and  high  tech  computers.  I  also  feel  that  many  of  these  bids  and  asks  are  already  programmed  to  appear  once  there  is  a  price  change.  So  once  one  price  gets  bought,  computers  will  put  in  higher  bids  to  take  over  asks.  It's  like  a  virtual  war  between  trading  firms  and  their  computers.  When  more  money  is  on  the  buy  side  the  stock  will  go  up,  and  vice  versa.  I  sort  of  feel  like  this  high-frequency  trading  is  detrimental  to  the  markets  and  doesn't  really  give  everyone  a  fair  shot.  Retail  investors  do  not  have  the  resources  and  knowledge  in  order  to  do  this  sort  of  high  frequency  trading.  It  also  seems  to  go  against  certain  free  market  principles  in  my  opinion.
251813	Orders  large  enough  to  buy  down  the  current  Bid  and  Ask  Book  are  common.  This  is  the  essential  strategy  through  which  larger  traders  "Strip"  the  Bid  or  Ask  in  order  to  excite  motion  in  a  direction  that  is  favorable  to  their  interests.  Smaller  traders  will  often  focus  on  low  float/small  cap  tickers,  as  both  conditions  tend  to  favor  volatility  on  relatively  small  volume.
374309	If  you've  got  shares  in  a  company  that's  filed  for  U.S.  Chapter  11  bankruptcy,  that  sucks,  it  really  does.    I've  been  there  before  and  you  may  lose  your  entire  investment.    If  there's  still  a  market  for  your  shares  and  you  can  sell  them,  you  may  want  to  just  accept  the  loss  and  get  out  with  what  you  can.  However,  shares  of  bankrupt  companies  are  often  delisted  once  bankrupt,  since  the  company  no  longer  meets  minimum  exchange  listing  requirements.    If  you're  stuck  holding  shares  with  no  market,  you  could  lose  everything  –  but  that's  not  always  the  case:  Chapter  11  isn't  total  and  final  bankruptcy  where  the  company  ceases  to  exist  after  liquidation  of  its  assets  to  pay  off  its  debts.    Rather,  Chapter  11  is  a  section  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code  that  permits  a  company  to  attempt  to  reorganize  (or  renegotiate)  its  debt  obligations.  During  Chapter  11  reorganization,  a  company  can  negotiate  with  its  creditors  for  a  better  arrangement.    They  typically  need  to  demonstrate  to  creditors  that  without  the  burden  of  the  heavy  debt,  they  could  achieve  profitability.    Such  reorganization  often  involves  creditors  taking  complete  or  majority  ownership  of  the  company  when  it  emerges  from  Chapter  11  through  a  debt-for-equity  swap.  That's  why  you,  as  an  investor  before  the  bankruptcy,  are  very  likely  to  get  nothing  or  just  pennies  on  the  dollar.  Any  equity  you  may  be  left  holding  will  be  considerably  diluted  in  value.    It's  rare  that  shareholders  before  a  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  still  retain  any  equity  after  the  company  emerges  from  Chapter  11,  but  it  is  possible.  But  it  varies  from  bankruptcy  to  bankruptcy  and  it  can  be  complex  as  montyloree  pointed  out.  Investopedia  has  a  great  article:  An  Overview  of  Corporate  Bankruptcy.    Here's  an  excerpt:  If  a  company  you've  got  a  stake  in      files  for  bankruptcy,  chances  are      you'll  get  back  pennies  to  the  dollar.      Different  bankruptcy  proceedings  or      filings  generally  give  some  idea  as  to      whether  the  average  investor  will  get      back  all  or  a  portion  of  his      investment,  but  even  that  is      determined  on  a  case-by-case  basis.      There  is  also  a  pecking  order  of      creditors  and  investors  of  who  get      paid  back  first,  second  and  last.  In      this  article,  we'll  explain  what      happens  when  a  public  company  files      for  protection  under  U.S.  bankruptcy      laws  and  how  it  affects  investors.      [...]      How  It  Affects  Investors      [...]      When  your  company  goes  bankrupt,  there      is  a  very  good  chance  you  will  not  get      back  the  full  value  of  your      investment.  In  fact,  there  is  a  chance      you  won't  get  anything  back.  [...]  Wikipedia  has  a  good  article  on  Chapter  11  bankruptcy  at  Chapter  11,  Title  11,  United  States  Code.
289120	I  held  shares  in  BIND  Therapeutics,  a  small  biotechnology  company  on  the  NASDAQ  that  was  liquidated  on  the  chapter  11  auction  block  in  2016.  There  were  sufficient  proceeds  to  pay  the  debts  and  return  some  cash  to  shareholders,  with  payments  in  2016  and  2017.  (Some  payments  have  yet  to  occur.)  The  whole  process  is  counter-intuitive  and  full  of  landmines,  both  for  tax  preparation  &  planning  and  receiving  payments:  Landmine  0:  Some  shareholders  will  sell  in  a  panic  as  soon  as  the  chapter  11  is  announced.    This  would  have  been  a  huge  mistake  in  the  case  of  BIND,  because  the  eventual  liquidation  payments  were  worth  3  or  so  times  as  much  as  the  share  price  after  chapter  11.    The  amount  of  the  liquidation  payments  wasn't  immediately  calculable,  because  the  company's  intellectual  property  had  to  be  auctioned.  Landmine  1:  The  large  brokerages  (Vanguard,  Fidelity,  TDA,  and  others)  mischaracterized  the  distributions  to  shareholders  on  form  1099,  distributed  to  both  shareholders  and  the  IRS.  The  bankruptcy  trustee  considered  this  to  be  their  responsibility.  According  to  the  tax  code  and  to  the  IRS  website,  the  liquidation  is  taxed  like  a  sale  of  stock,  rather  than  a  dividend.  "On  the  shareholder  level,  a  complete  liquidation  can  be  thought  of  as  a  sale  of  all  outstanding  corporate  stock  held  by  the  shareholders  in  exchange  for  all  of  the  assets  in  that  corporation.  Like  any  sale  of  stock,  the  shareholder  receives  capital  gain  treatment  on  the  difference  between  the  amount  received  by  the  shareholder  in  the  distribution  and  the  cost  or  other  basis  of  the  stock."  Mischaracterizing  the  distributions  as  dividends  makes  them  wrongly  ineligible  to  be  wiped  out  by  the  enormous  capital  loss  on  the  stock.    Vanguard's  error  appeared  on  my  own  1099,  and  the  others  were  mentioned  in  an  investor  discussion  on  stocktwits.    However,  Geoffrey  L  Berman,  the  bankruptcy  trustee  stated  on  twitter  that  while  the  payments  are  NOT  dividends,  the  1099s  were  the  brokers'  responsibility.  Landmine  2:  Many  shareholders  will  wrongly  attempt  to  claim  the  capital  loss  for  tax  year  2016,  or  they  may  have  failed  to  understand  the  law  in  time  for  proper  tax  planning  for  tax  year  2016.  It  does  not  matter  that  the  company's  BINDQ  shares  were  cancelled  in  2016.    According  to  the  IRS  website  "When  a  shareholder  receives  a  series  of  distributions  in  liquidation,  gain  is  recognized  once  all  of  the  shareholder's  stock  basis  is  recovered.  A  loss,  however,  will  not  be  recognized  until  the  final  distribution  is  received."  In  particular,  shareholders  who  receive  the  2017  payment  will  not  be  able  to  take  a  capital  loss  for  tax  year  2016  because  the  liquidation  wasn't  complete.    Late  discovery  of  this  timing  issue  no  doubt  resulted  in  an  end-of-year  underestimation  of  2016  overall  capital  gains  for  many,  causing  a  failure  to  preemptively  realize  available  capital  losses  elsewhere.  I'm  not  going  to  carefully  consider  the  following  issues,  which  may  or  may  not  have  some  effect  on  the  timing  of  the  capital  loss:  Landmine  3:  Surprisingly,  it  appears  that  some  shareholders  who  sold  their  shares  in  2016  still  may  not  claim  the  capital  loss  for  tax  year  2016,  because  they  will  receive  a  liquidation  distribution  in  2017.  Taken  at  face  value,  the  IRS  website's  statement  "A  loss,  however,  will  not  be  recognized  until  the  final  distribution  is  received"  appears  to  apply  to  shareholders  of  record  of  August  30,  2016,  who  receive  the  payouts,  even  if  they  sold  the  shares  after  the  record  date.    However,  to  know  for  sure  it  might  be  worth  carefully  parsing  the  relevant  tax  code  and  treasury  regs.  Landmine  4:  Some  shareholders  are  completely  cut  out  of  the  bankruptcy  distribution.  The  bankruptcy  plan  only  provides  distributions  for  shareholders  of  record  Aug  30,  2016.    Those  who  bought  shares  of  BINDQ  afterwards  are  out  of  luck.  Landmine  5:  According  to  the  discussion  on  stocktwits,  many  shareholders  have  yet  to  receive  or  even  learn  of  the  existence  of  a  form  [more  secure  link  showing  brokers  served  here]  required  to  accept  2017  payments.    To  add  to  confusion  there  is  apparently  ongoing  legal  wrangling  over  whether  the  trustee  is  able  to  require  this  form.  Worse,  shareholders  report  difficulty  getting  brokers'  required  cooperation  in  submitting  this  form.  Landmine  6:  Hopefully  there  are  no  more  landmines.  Boom.

67785	I  won't  be  able  to  model  stock  prices  using  this  information.    The  pros  aren't  likely  to  use  Google  as  much.  Even  the  casual  investor  is  likely  to  have  his  own  habits.  For  example,  I've  come  to  like  how  Yahoo  permits  me  to  set  up  a  portfolio  and  follow  the  stocks  I  want.  And  the  information  that  interests  me  is  there,  laid  out  nicely,  price,  history,  insider  trades,  news  etc.    But  your  effort  probably  still  has  some  discovery  value,  as  it  will  help  you  understand  when  interest  in  a  company  suddenly  swells  above  normal.  Nothing  wrong  with  a  good  project  like  that.  Just  don't  expect  to  extract  too  much  market-beating  success  from  it.  The  pros  will  eat  your  lunch,  take  your  money,  and  not  even  say  thanks.  Welcome  to  Money.SE.
165669	You  definitely  cannot  be  guaranteed  to  get  the  bid  or  ask  if  you  are  selling  more  than  are  available/desired  at  those  prices.  What  prices  you  do  get  depends  on  who  is  watching  that  contract  and  how  willing  they  are  to  trade  with  you.  This  question  is  not  much  different  from  the  question  of  whether  you  can  easily  get  into  or  out  of  a  large  position  in  an  illiquid  small  stock  easily.    You  can  get  out  quickly  if  you  are  willing  to  take  pennies  on  the  dollar,  or  you  may  get  a  reasonable  price  if  you  take  a  long  time  to  get  out  of  (or  into)  your  position.    You  can't  normally  do  both.  In  general  taking  large  positions  in  illiquid  assets  is  not  something  people  want  to  do  without  lining  up  a  buyer/seller  beforehand.    Instead  see  if  you  can  achieve  your  objective  with  liquid  investments.
118389	One  broker  told  me  that  I  have  to  simply  read  the  ask  size  and  the  bid  size,  seeing  what  the  market  makers  are  offering.  This  implies  that  my  order  would  have  to  match  that  price  exactly,  which  is  unfortunate  because  options  contract  spreads  can  be  WIDE.  Also,  if  my  planned  position  size  is  larger  than  the  best  bid/best  ask,  then  I  should  break  up  the  order,  which  is  also  unfortunate  because  most  brokers  charge  a  lot  for  options  orders.
4666	@sharam  -  big  question.    I  am  going  to  answer  part  of  it,  but  not  as  directly  as  you  might  like.  You  mention  4-6  cents  per  unit  per  month,  but  fail  to  give  a  unit  price,  so  it  is  hard  to  tell  how  much  return  you  are  really  looking  for.  Given  the  amount  you  have  to  invest,  depending  on  your  time  horizon,  you  will  do  much  better  outside  of  mutual  funds.    Many  funds  in  this  category  have  fees  in  the  2%  range.    You  actually  have  enough  money  to  have  a  diversified  portfolio  on  your  own,  without  recourse  to  funds.  If  you  want  to  use  a  fund-like  product,  I  encourage  you  to  look  at  well  established  ETFs  (Exchange  Traded  Funds).    They  are  basically  like  mutual  funds  that  trade  on  the  open  stock  market.    One  good  example  in  this  category  is  iShares  XDV  Good  Luck
326724	I  haven't  seen  one  of  these  in  quite  some  time.  Back  in  the  1970s,  maybe  the  1980s,  stock  brokers  would  occasionally  send  their  retail  clients  a  complimentary  copy  once  in  a  while.  Also,  I  remember  the  local  newspaper  would  offer  a  year-end  edition  for  a  few  dollars  (maybe  $3)  and  that  edition  would  include  the  newspaper  company's  name  on  the  cover.  They  were  very  handy  little  guides  measuring  5  1/2  x  8  (horizontal)  with  one  line  devoted  to  each  company.  They  listed  hundreds  of  publicly  traded  companies  and  had  basic  info  on  each  company.  As  you  stated,  for  further  info  you  needed  to  go  to  the  library  and  follow-up  with  the  big  S&P  and/or  Moody's  manuals.  That  was  long  before  the  internet  made  such  info  available  at  the  click  of  a  button  on  a  home  computer!
303649	Log  in  to  your  Scottrade  account,  and  goto  Markets  -->  Analyst  Views  -->  Click  the  PDF  link  for  the  company.    Also,  there  is  also  the  'Views  and  News'  part  of  the  web  page  which  has  additional  information  beyond  what  exist  in  the  reports.
590879	I  would  go  even  farther  than  Victor's  answer.    There  is  little  evidence  that  candlestick  patterns  and  technical  analysis  in  general  have  any  predictive  power.      Even  if  they  did  in  the  past,  of  which  there  is  some  evidence,  in  modern  times  they  are  so  easy  to  do  on  computers  that  if  they  worked  algorithmic  traders  would  have  scanned  almost  all  traded  stocks  and  bought/sold  the  stock  before  you  even  had  a  chance  to  look  at  the  graph.  While  the  best  technical  traders  who  are  very  good  at  quickly  using  pattern  recognition  across  many  indicators  as  Victor  mentioned  might  be  able  to  add  some  advantage.    The  odds  that  a  pattern  so  simple  to  code  such  as  Bullish  Engulfing  would  have  predictive  power  is  tiny.
361976	I  love  technical  analysis,  and  use  candlesticks  as  part  of  my  technical  analysis  system  for  trading  mutual  funds  in  my  401K.  However,  I  would  never  use  a  candlestick  chart  on  its  own.    I  use  combination  of  candlesticks,  2  different  EMAs,  MACD,  bollinger  bands,  RSI  and  hand  drawn  trend  lines  that  I  constantly  tweak.    That's  about  as  much  data  input  as  I  can  handle,  but  it  is  possible  to  graph  it  all  at  once  and  see  it  at  a  glance  if  you  have  the  right  trading  platform.  My  approach  is  very  personal,  not  very  aggressive,  and  took  me  years  to  develop.  But  it's  fairly  effective  -  90%  +  of  my  trades  are  winners.  The  big  advantage  of  technical  analysis  is  that  it  forces  you  to  create  repeatable  rules  around  which  you  base  your  trading.    A  lot  of  the  time  I  have  little  attention  at  all  on  what  fund  I  am  trading  or  why  it  is  doing  well  in  that  particular  market  condition.  It's  basically  irrelevant  as  the  technical  system  tells  when  to  buy  and  sell,  and  stops  you  trying  to  second  guess  whether  housing,  chemicals,  gold  or  asian  tigers  are  is  doing  well  right  now.  If  you  don't  keep  to  your  own  rules,  you  have  only  yourself  to  blame.  This  keeps  you  from  blaming  the  market,  which  is  completely  out  of  your  control.  I  explain  many  of  my  trades  with  anotated  graphs  at  http://neurotrade.blogspot.com/
594159	I  did  a  historical  analysis  a  few  years  back  of  all  well-known  candlestick  patterns  against  my  database  of  5  years  worth  of  1-minute  resolution  data  of  all  FTSE100  shares.    There  wasn't  a  single  pattern  that  showed  even  a  1%  gain  with  60%  reliability.    Unfortunately  I  don't  have  spread  data  other  than  for  a  handful  of  days  where  I  recorded  live  prices  rather  than  minutely  summaries,  but  my  suspicion  is  that  most  of  the  time  you  wouldn't  even  earn  back  the  spread  on  such  a  trade.
234002	By  definition,  there  are  no  guaranteed  profits.  There  are  sometimes  arbitrage  opportunities,  which  are  more  accessible  to  some  investors  than  others.  In  this  case,  I'm  not  referring  to  HFT  as  that  is  covered  elsewhere  on  this  site  already.    At  certain  times,  in  certain  equity  markets,  candlestick  charts  were  used  for  profitable  trading,  though  more  for  trades  set  up  for  weeks  or  months,  not  day  trading.  I  am  referring  specifically  to  Nikkei  225  equities,  in  the  1980's  and  1990's.  I  don't  know  why  it  was  effective,  and  it  hasn't  worked  for  me  since  then.  I  recommend  reading  and  heeding  this  answer.  Some  people  DO  use  technical  analysis  (see  "TA  is  not..."  section)  as  a  primary  trading  strategy,  but  they  are  not  going  to  divulge  their  methods,  not  here  nor  anywhere  else.
67124	John  Person  has  a  pattern  called  the  High  Close  Doji  that  is  probably  the  most  reliable  signal  in  the  world  of  candle  patterns.  I  would  check  out  Candle  Stick  and  Pivot  Point  Trade  Triggers.  It  all  I  use  in  trading  stocks  +  forex.
531505	Nothing  is  guaranteed  -  candlesticks  are  not  crystal  balls  nor  is  any  part  of  technical  analysis.  Candlestick  patterns  used  correctly  and  in  combination  with  other  western  technical  indicators  can  increase  the  probability  of  a  trade  going  into  the  derived  direction,  but  they  are  not  a  guarantee  -  which  is  why  you  should  always  use  stop  losses  with  your  candlestick  or  any  trading.  In  saying  that,  another  candlestick  pattern  that  can  provide  high  probability  trades  is  the  Doji,  or  a  combination  of  Dojis  in  a  row  at  a  market  extreme.  Note  that  both  Engulfing  patterns  and  Dojis  work  best  at  price  extremes  (highs  and  lows)  and  in  combination  with  other  technical  indicators  such  as  an  overbought  momentum  indicator  at  a  market  high,  or  an  oversold  momentum  indicator  at  a  market  low.  EDIT  -  An  Example  Here  is  a  sample  trade  I  placed  on  the  17th  October  and  am  currently  15.6%  in  profit  on.  See  the  chart  below  as  it  shows  taking  the  trade  on  the  open  of  the  following  day  after  a  bullish  engulfing  pattern  appeared  at  the  bottom  of  a  downtrend  on  the  16th  in  combination  with  the  Slow  Stochastic  crossing  over  in  the  oversold  region  (below  20%).  I  would  consider  this  a  high  probability  trade  and  have  placed  an  initial  stop  loss  at  10%  below  my  open  price  in  case  the  trade  went  against  me.  As  the  price  moved  up  I  moved  the  10%  stop  loss  up  as  a  trailing  stop  loss.  My  profit  target  is  set  at  25%  or  $4.00.
98555	A  good  poker  player  lowers  the  bet  on  the  downside  and  increases  it  on  the  up,  by  3  to  10  times.  They'll  win,  and  then  when  the  mood  swings,  generally  3  -5  consecutive  downs,  it`s  time  to  reduce  the  bet  back  to  1.  I  gambled  for  a  year  fulltime  -  a  guest  of  the  house  you  might  say,  and  I  managed  to  make  a  living  using  this  system.
27416	For  the  first  and  last  questions,  I  can  do  this  multiple  ways.    For  the  middle  question,  I'll  just  make  up  values.    If  you  want  different  ones,  you  will  have  to  redo  the  math.      I  am  going  to  assume  that  you  participate  in  the  merger  exchange,  swapping  your  share  for  their  offer.      If  you  own  one  share,  it  depends  how  they  handle  fractional  shares.    Your  original  one  share  of  ABC  can  be  worth  either  one  share  of  XYZ  or  1.05  shares  of  XYZ.    If  you  get  one  share,  you  typically  get  an  additional  $.80  cash  to  make  up  for  the  fractional  share.      You  might  ask  why  you  don't  just  get  $20  cash  and  one  share  of  XYZ.    Consider  the  case  where  you  own  twenty  shares  of  ABC.    Then  you'd  own  twenty-one  shares  of  XYZ  and  $384.    No  need  for  fractional  shares.      Beyond  all  this  though,  the  share  value  of  XYZ  is  not  set  autocratically.    The  shares  might  be  worth  $16,  $40,  or  $2  after  the  merger.    If  both  stocks  are  perfectly  valued  and  the  market  is  aware  of  that  value,  then  it  will  depend  partially  on  the  number  of  shares  of  each.      For  example,  if  we  assume  there  are  10,000  shares  of  ABC  and  50,000  shares  of  XYZ  (including  the  shares  paid  for  ABC),  then  their  initial  market  values  are  $320,000  for  ABC  and  $800,000  for  XYZ.    XYZ  is  paying  $360,000,  so  its  value  drops  to  $440,000.    But  it  is  gaining  ABC,  which  is  worth  $320,000.    Net  value  now  is  $760,000  or  $15.20  per  share.      This  has  assumed  that  the  shares  transferred  from  XYZ  to  the  shareholders  of  ABC  were  already  included  in  the  market  value.    This  may  mean  that  the  stock  price  was  previously  $20  or  so  with  almost  40,000  shares  in  circulation.    Then  they  issued  new  shares,  diluting  the  value  down  to  $16.    We  could  start  at  50,000  shares  at  $16  and  end  up  with  60,000  to  60,050  shares  at  $13.332  to  $13.333  per  share.    Then  XYZ  is  really  only  paying  $326,658.31  for  ABC.    That's  a  premium  of  only  $6,658.31  for  ABC  and  gives  a  final  stock  value  of  $13.222  per  share.      The  problem  though  is  that  in  reality,  there  is  no  equivalent  of  perfect  value.    So  I  say  again  that  the  market  value  might  be  $15.20  (the  theoretic  answer  that  best  fits  the  question  given  the  example  quantities  of  shares),  $13,  $20,  or  something  else.    It  will  depend  on  how  the  market  perceives  the  deal.    Is  the  combined  company  worth  more  or  less  than  the  sum  of  its  parts?      And  beyond  this,  you  will  have  $19.20  to  $20  in  cash  in  addition  to  your  XYZ  share  (or  1.05  shares).    Assuming  1.05  shares,  that  would  be  $15.96  plus  the  $19.20--that's  $35.16  total  in  theory  or  anything  from  $19.20  up  in  practice.    With  the  givens,  the  only  thing  of  which  you  can  be  sure  is  the  $19.20  cash.    The  value  of  the  stock  is  up  in  the  air.      If  XYZ  is  only  privately  traded,  this  is  still  true.    The  stock  is  worth  the  price  that  someone  will  pay  for  it.    The  "someone"  is  just  more  limited  with  privately  traded  stocks.
142401	It  depends.    If  you  accept  the  offer,  then  your  stock  will  cease  existing.    If  you  reject  the  offer,  then  you  will  become  a  minority  shareholder.    Depending  on  the  circumstances,  you  could  be  in  the  case  where  it  becomes  illegal  to  trade  your  shares.    That  can  happen  if  the  firm  ceases  to  be  a  public  company.    In  that  case,  you  would  discount  the  cash  flows  of  future  dividends  to  determine  worth  because  there  would  be  no  market  for  it.  If  the  firm  remained  public  and  also  was  listed  for  trading,  then  you  could  sell  your  shares  although  the  terms  and  conditions  in  the  market  would  depend  on  how  the  controlling  firm  managed  the  original  firm.
491899	If  this  is  a  one  to  one  share  exchange  with  added  cash  to  make  up  the  difference  in  value,  you're  getting  1  share  of  XYZ  plus  $19.20  in  cash  for  each  share  of  ABC.      They  calculated  the  per  share  price  they're  offering  ($36)  and  subtracted  the  value  of  XYZ  share  at  the  time  of  the  offer  ($16.80)  to  get  the  cash  part  ($19.20).      The  value  of  XYZ  after  is  subject  to  investor  reaction.    Nobody  can  accurately  predict  stock  values.    If  you  see  the  price  dropping,  owners  of  XYZ  are  selling  because  they  feel  that  they  no  longer  wish  to  own  XYZ.    If  XYZ  is  rising,  investors  feel  like  the  merger  is  a  positive  move  and  they  are  buying  (or  the  company  is  buying  back  shares).  Bottom  line  is  the  cash  is  a  sure  thing,  the  stock  is  not.    You  called  it  a  merger,  but  it's  actually  a  takeover.    My  advice  is  to  evaluate  both  stocks,  see  if  you  wish  to  continue  owning  XYZ,  and  determine  whether  you'd  rather  sell  ABC  or  take  the  offer.    The  value  of  ABC  afterwards,  if  you  decline  the  offer,  is  something  that  I  cannot  advise  you  on.
460347	As  has  been  pointed  out,  one  isn't  cheaper  than  the  other.  One  may  have  a  lower  price  per  share  than  the  other,  but  that's  not  the  same  thing.  Let's  pretend  that  the  total  market  valuation  of  all  the  stocks  within  the  index  was  $10,000,000.  (Look,  I  said  let's  pretend.)  You  want  to  invest  $1,000.  For  the  time  being,  let's  also  pretend  that  your  purchasing  0.01%  of  all  the  stock  won't  affect  prices  anywhere.  One  company  splits  the  index  into  10,000  parts  worth  $1,000  each.  The  other  splits  the  same  index  into  10,000,000  parts  worth  $1  each.  Both  track  the  underlying  index  perfectly.  If  you  invest  $1,000  with  the  first  company,  you  get  one  part;  if  you  invest  $1,000  with  the  second,  you  get  1,000  parts.  Ignoring  spreads,  transaction  fees  and  the  like,  immediately  after  the  purchase,  both  are  worth  exactly  $1,000  to  you.  Now,  suppose  the  index  goes  up  2%.  The  first  company's  shares  of  the  index  (of  which  you  would  have  exactly  one)  are  now  worth  $1,020  each,  and  the  second  company's  shares  of  the  index  (of  which  you  would  have  exactly  1,000)  are  worth  $1.02  each.  In  each  case,  you  now  have  index  shares  valued  at  $1,020  for  a  2%  increase  ($1,020  /  $1,000  =  1.02  =  102%  of  your  original  investment).  As  you  can  see,  there  is  no  reason  to  look  at  the  price  per  share  unless  you  have  to  buy  in  terms  of  whole  shares,  which  is  common  in  the  stock  market  but  not  necessarily  common  at  all  in  mutual  funds.  Because  in  this  case,  both  funds  track  the  same  underlying  index,  there  is  no  real  reason  to  purchase  one  rather  than  the  other  because  you  believe  they  will  perform  differently.  In  an  ideal  world,  the  two  will  perform  exactly  equally.  The  way  to  compare  the  price  of  mutual  funds  is  to  look  at  the  expense  ratio.  The  lower  the  expense  ratio  is,  the  cheaper  the  fund  is,  and  the  less  of  your  money  is  being  eroded  every  day  in  fees.  Unless  you  have  some  very  good  reason  to  do  differently,  that  is  how  you  should  compare  the  price  of  any  investment  vehicles  that  track  the  same  underlying  commodity  (in  this  case,  the  S&P  500).
107462	So,  why  or  why  should  I  not  invest  in  the  cheaper  index  fund?  They  are  both  same,  one  is  not  cheaper  than  other.  You  get  something  that  is  worth  $1000.    To  give  a  simple  illustration;  There  is  an  item  for  $100,  Vanguard  creates  10  Units  out  of  this  so  price  per  unit  is  $10.  Schwab  creates  25  units  out  of  this,  so  the  per  unit  price  is  $4.  Now  if  you  are  looking  at  investing  $20;  with  Vanguard  you  would  get  2  units,  with  Schwab  you  would  get  5  units.  This  does  not  mean  one  is  cheaper  than  other.  Both  are  at  the  same  value  of  $20.      The  Factors  you  need  to  consider  are;  Related  question  What  differentiates  index  funds  and  ETFs?
340143	Cheaper  would  refer  to  the  fees  of  a  fund  rather  than  the  share  price,  IMO.  Are  2  quarters  worth  more  or  less  than  10  nickels?  This  is  another  way  to  express  your  question  though  most  open-end  funds  bought  directly  from  the  fund  family  or  through  fund  supermarkets  would  do  fractional  shares  that  may  be  better  than  going  through  ETFs  though  there  can  be  some  brokers  like  Sharebuilder  that  used  to  do  fractional  shares  though  not  necessarily  having  the  best  execution  as  I  recall.
490497	Back  in  the  late  80's  I  had  a  co-worked  do  exactly  this.  In  those  days  you  could  only  do  things  quarterly:  change  the  percentage,  change  the  investment  mix,  make  a  withdrawal..  There  were  no  Roth  401K  accounts,  but  contributions  could  be  pre-tax  or  post-tax.  Long  term  employees  were  matched  100%  up  to  8%,  newer  employees  were  only  matched  50%  up  to  8%  (resulting  in  4%  match).  Every  quarter  this  employee  put  in  8%,  and  then  pulled  out  the  previous  quarters  contribution.  The  company  match  continued  to  grow.    Was  it  smart?  He  still  ended  up  with  8%  going  into  the  401K.  In  those  pre-Enron  days  the  law  allowed  companies  to  limit  the  company  match  to  100%  company  stock  which  meant  that  employees  retirement  was  at  risk.  Of  course  by  the  early  2000's  the  stock  that  was  purchased  for  $6  a  share  was  worth  $80  a  share...  Now  what  about  the  IRS:  Since  I  make  designated  Roth  contributions  from  after-tax  income,  can  I  make  tax-free  withdrawals  from  my  designated  Roth  account  at  any      time?  No,  the  same  restrictions  on  withdrawals  that  apply  to  pre-tax      elective  contributions  also  apply  to  designated  Roth  contributions.  If      your  plan  permits  distributions  from  accounts  because  of  hardship,  you      may  choose  to  receive  a  hardship  distribution  from  your  designated      Roth  account.  The  hardship  distribution  will  consist  of  a  pro-rata      share  of  earnings  and  basis  and  the  earnings  portion  will  be  included      in  gross  income  unless  you  have  had  the  designated  Roth  account  for  5      years  and  are  either  disabled  or  over  age  59  ½.  Regarding  getting  just  contributions:  What  happens  if  I  take  a  distribution  from  my  designated  Roth  account  before  the  end  of  the  5-taxable-year  period?  If  you  take  a  distribution  from  your  designated  Roth  account  before      the  end  of  the  5-taxable-year  period,  it  is  a  nonqualified      distribution.  You  must  include  the  earnings  portion  of  the      nonqualified  distribution  in  gross  income.  However,  the  basis  (or      contributions)  portion  of  the  nonqualified  distribution  is  not      included  in  gross  income.  The  basis  portion  of  the  distribution  is      determined  by  multiplying  the  amount  of  the  nonqualified  distribution      by  the  ratio  of  designated  Roth  contributions  to  the  total  designated      Roth  account  balance.  For  example,  if  a  nonqualified  distribution  of      $5,000  is  made  from  your  designated  Roth  account  when  the  account      consists  of  $9,400  of  designated  Roth  contributions  and  $600  of      earnings,  the  distribution  consists  of  $4,700  of  designated  Roth      contributions  (that  are  not  includible  in  your  gross  income)  and  $300      of  earnings  (that  are  includible  in  your  gross  income).  See  Q&As  regarding  Rollovers  of  Designated  Roth  Contributions,  for      additional  rules  for  rolling  over  both  qualified  and  nonqualified      distributions  from  designated  Roth  accounts.
596567	Your  wife  could  open  a  non-registered  margin  trading  account  with  a  Canadian  full-service  or  discount  broker.  An  account  at  one  of  the  top  Canadian  brokers  should  provide  access  to  trade  U.S.-listed  options.  I've  traded  both  Canadian  and  U.S.-listed  options  with  my  own  broker.  On  the  application,  you'd  need  to  indicate  an  interest  in  trading  options,  and  more  specifically,  what  kind  of  option  trades;  e.g.  long  puts  and  calls  only,  covered  writing,  combination  trades,  etc.  And  yes,  part  of  the  application  approval  process  (at  least  when  I  went  through  it)  is  to  answer  a  few  questions  to  prove  that  the  applicant  is  aware  of  the  types  of  risks  with  trading  options.  Be  sure  to  do  some  research  on  the  fees  and  currency/fx  aspects  before  you  choose  a  broker.    If  you  plan  to  exercise  any  options  purchased  or  expect  to  be  assigned  for  any  you  write,  be  aware  that  those  fees  are  often  different  from  the  headline  cost-per-trade  advertised  by  brokers.  For  instance,  I  pay  in  excess  of  $40  when  a  call  option  I  write  gets  assigned,  vs.  ~$10  that  I'd  pay  if  I  just  plain  sold  the  stock.  One  other  thing  to  investigate  is  what  kind  of  online  option  trading  research  and  order  entry  tools  are  available;  not  every  broker  has  the  same  set  of  features  with  respect  to  options  —  especially  if  it  isn't  a  big  part  of  their  business.
383162	EDIT:  It  was  System  Disruption  or  Malfunctions  August  24,  2015  2:12  PM  EDT      Pursuant  to  Rule  11890(b)  NASDAQ,  on  its  own  motion,  in  conjunction      with  BATS,  and  FINRA  has  determined  to  cancel  all  trades  in  security      Blackrock  Capital  Investment.  (Nasdaq:  BKCC)  at  or  below  $5.86  that      were  executed  in  NASDAQ  between  09:38:00  and  09:46:00  ET.  This      decision  cannot  be  appealed.  NASDAQ  will  be  canceling  trades  on  the      participants  behalf.  A  person  on  Reddit  claimed  that  he  was  the  buyer.  He  used  Robinhood,  a  $0  commission  broker  and  start-up.    The  canceled  trades  are  reflected  on  CTA/UTP  and  the  current  charts  will  differ  from  the  one  posted  below.    It  is  an  undesired  effect  of  the  5-minute  Trading  Halt.    It  is  not  "within  1  hour  of  opening,  BKCC  traded  between  $0.97  and  $9.5".    Those  trades  only  occurred  for  a  few  seconds  on  two  occasions.    One  possible  reason  is  that  when  the  trading  halt  ended,  there  was  a  lot  of  Market  Order  to  sell  accumulated.    Refer  to  the  following  chart,  where  each  candle  represents  a  10  second  period.  As  you  can  see,  the  low  prices  did  not  "sustain"  for  hours.      And  the  published  halts.
417407	As  you  know,  the  market  is  in  turmoil  today.  At  this  moment,  11:45  am,  the  S&P  is  down  2.3%,  45  points.  But,  premarket,  it  was  down  100  points.    Now,  premarket,  I  heard  Jim  Cramer  say,  "today  is  not  the  day  to  use  market  orders."  Yes,  on  Mad  Money,  he  seems  a  bit  eccentric,  but  he  does  offer  some  wise  advice  at  times.    In  my  opinion,  your  stock  had  some  people  that  did  just  that.  A  market  order.  And,  regardless  of  the  fundamentals  of  this  company,  buyers  had  no  orders  to  buy.  Except  a  couple  wise  guys  (in  both  senses)  that  put  in  buys  at  crazy  prices.  And  they  filled.  With  an  Apple,  trading  around  $100,  the  book  probably  has  millions  of  shares  on  order  with  a  buy  at  $80  or  higher.  Just  an  example.  I'd  bet  there  were  a  number  of  stocks  that  had  the  profile  of  yours,  i.e.  a  chart  reflecting  trades  similar  to  a  flash  crash.  There  are  some  traders  smiling  ear  to  ear,  and  some  crying  in  their  beer.          (Note  -  I  use  the  phrase  "in  my  opinion."  This  is  the  only  explanation  I  can  imagine.  Occam's  Razor.)
357324	Cart's  answer  is  basically  correct,  but  I'd  like  to  elaborate:  A  futures  contract  obligates  both  the  buyer  of  a  contract  and  the  seller  of  a  contract  to  conduct  the  underlying  transaction  (settle)  at  the  agreed-upon  future  date  and  price  written  into  the  contract.  Aside  from  settlement,  the  only  other  way  either  party  can  get  out  of  the  transaction  is  to  initiate  a  closing  transaction,  which  means:    The  party  that  sold  the  contract  buys  back  another  similar  contract  to  close  his  position.    The  party  that  bought  the  contract  can  sell  the  contract  on  to  somebody  else.  Whereas,  an  option  contract  provides  the  buyer  of  the  option  with  the  choice  of  completing  the  transaction.    Because  it's  a  choice,  the  buyer  can  choose  to  walk  away  from  the  transaction  if  the  option  exercise  price  is  not  attractive  relative  to  the  underlying  stock  price  at  the  date  written  into  the  contract.    When  an  option  buyer  walks  away,  the  option  is  said  to  have  expired.  However  –  and  this  is  the  part  I  think  needs  elaboration  –  the  original  seller  (writer)  of  the  option  contract  doesn't  have  a  choice.    If  a  buyer  chooses  to  exercise  the  option  contract  the  seller  wrote,  the  seller  is  obligated  to  conduct  the  transaction.    In  such  a  case,  the  seller's  option  contract  is  said  to  have  been  assigned.    Only  if  the  buyer  chooses  not  to  exercise  does  the  seller's  obligation  go  away.    Before  the  option  expires,  the  option  seller  can  close  their  position  by  initiating  a  closing  transaction.    But,  the  seller  can't  simply  walk  away  like  the  option  buyer  can.
302164	For  futures,  you  are  obligated  to  puchase  the  security  at  $x  when  the  contract  expires.    For  an  option,  you  have  the  right  or  option  to  do  so  if  it's  favorable  to  you.
331108	Adding  a  couple  more  assumptions,  I'd  compute  about  $18.23  would  be  that  pay  out  in  2018.    This  is  computed  by  taking  the  Current  Portfolio's  Holdings  par  values  and  dividing  by  the  outstanding  shares(92987/5100  for  those  wanting  specific  figures  used).  Now,  for  those  assumptions:  Something  to  keep  in  mind  is  that  bonds  can  valued  higher  than  their  face  value  if  the  coupon  is  higher  than  other  issues  given  the  same  risk.    If  you  have  2  bonds  maturing  in  3  years  of  the  same  face  value  and  same  risk  categories  though  one  is  paying  5%  and  the  other  is  paying  10%  then  it  may  be  that  the  5%  sells  at  a  discount  to  bring  the  yield  up  some  while  the  other  sells  at  a  premium  to  bring  the  yield  down.    Thus,  you  could  have  bonds  worth  more  before  they  mature  that  will  eventually  lose  this  capital  appreciation.
65782	Your  inference  in  #1  is  incorrect.    The  million  dollars  he  has  contributed  is  going  to  be  part  of  the  assets  of  the  fund.    This  is  common  practice  and  is  a  way  for  the  founder  to  express  confidence  that  the  fund  will  make  money.    He  wants  you  to  come  up  with  a  model  that  he  can  then  use  to  trade  those  assets.    Presumably  he  will  give  you  some  money  if  he  uses  your  model  and  it  works.  Regarding  #2,  there  are  lots  of  ways  of  getting  data.    Sometimes  you  can  buy  it  directly  from  the  exchange.    You  can  also  buy  from  vendors  like  tickdata.com.    There  are  lots  of  such  vendors.    Since  he  makes  a  big  deal  about  saying  it's  expensive,  I'm  assuming  he  is  talking  about  data  at  relatively  high  frequency  (not  daily,  which  would  be  cheap).    Stock  data  is  still  not  bad.    Complete  US  data  would  be  a  few  thousand  dollars  (maybe  20K  at  the  most).    For  someone  sitting  at  home  with  no  capital,  that's  a  lot  of  money,  but  for  a  hedge  fund  it's  nothing.  As  an  institutional  investor,  your  broker  will  give  you  a  data  feed  that  will  provide  all  prices  in  real  time  (but  not  historically).    If  he's  been  in  operation  a  while,  he  could  have  just  saved  the  prices  as  they  came  out  of  the  pipe.    I  don't  think  that's  the  case  here,  though,  based  on  how  young  he  is  and  how  little  money  is  involved.  In  short,  he  paid  for  some  data  and  has  "encrypted"  it  in  such  a  way  that  he  can  legally  share  it  for  free.    Supposedly  his  method  preserves  the  structure  so  that  you  could  write  a  trading  model  based  on  the  encrypted  data  and  it  would  work  on  real  data.    Once  you  have  a  good  trading  model,  you  sell  it  to  him  and  he  will  use  it  to  trade  his  million  dollars  and  whatever  other  money  he  is  able  to  gather.
189868	That  expense  ratio  on  the  bank  fund  is  criminally  high.  Use  the  Vanguard  one,  they  have  really  low  expenses.
520963	Your  bank's  fund  is  not  an  index  fund.    From  your  link:  To  provide  a  balanced  portfolio  of  primarily  Canadian  securities  that  produce  income  and  capital  appreciation  by  investing  primarily  in  Canadian  money  market  instruments,  debt  securities  and  common  and  preferred  shares.  This  is  a  very  broad  actively  managed  fund.    Compare  this  to  the  investment  objective  listed  for  Vanguard's  VOO:  Invests  in  stocks  in  the  S&P  500  Index,  representing  500  of  the  largest  U.S.  companies.  There  are  loads  of  market  indices  with  varying  formulas  that  are  supposed  to  track  the  performance  of  a  market  or  market  segment  that  they  intend  to  track.    The  Russel  2000,  The  Wilshire  1000,  The  S&P  500,  the  Dow  Industrial  Average,  there  is  even  the  SSGA  Gender  Diversity  Index.    Some  body  comes  up  with  a  market  index.    An  "Index  Fund"  is  simply  a  Mutual  Fund  or  Exchange  Traded  Fund  (ETF)  that  uses  a  market  index  formula  to  make  it's  investment  decisions  enabling  an  investor  to  track  the  performance  of  the  index  without  having  to  buy  and  sell  the  constituent  securities  on  their  own.    These  "index  funds"  are  able  to  charge  lower  fees  because  they  spend  $0  on  research,  and  only  make  investment  decisions  in  order  to  track  the  holdings  of  the  index.  I  think  1.2%  is  too  high,  but  I'm  coming  from  the  US  investing  world  it  might  not  be  that  high  compared  to  Canadian  offerings.    Additionally,  comparing  this  fund's  expense  ratio  to  the  Vanguard  500  or  Total  Market  index  fund  is  nonsensical.  Similarly,  comparing  the  investment  returns  is  nonsensical  because  one  tracks  the  S&P  500  and  one  does  not,  nor  does  it  seek  to  (as  an  example  the  #5  largest  holding  of  the  CIBC  fund  is  a  Government  of  Canada  2045  3.5%  bond).  Everyone  should  diversify  their  holdings  and  adjust  their  investment  allocations  as  they  age.    As  you  age  you  should  be  reallocating  away  from  highly  volatile  common  stock  and  in  to  assets  classes  that  are  historically  more  stable/less  volatile  like  national  government  debt  and  high  grade  corporate/local  government  debt.    This  fund  is  already  diversified  in  to  some  debt  instruments,  depending  on  your  age  and  other  asset  allocations  this  might  not  be  the  best  place  to  put  your  money  regardless  of  the  fees.  Personally,  I  handle  my  own  asset  allocations  and  I'm  split  between  Large,  Mid  and  Small  cap  low-fee  index  funds,  and  the  lowest  cost  high  grade  debt  funds  available  to  me.
453542	Extortionate  expense  ratio  aside,  comparing  the  fund  to  the  vanguard  balanced  fund  (with  an  expense  ratio  of  0.19%)  shows  that  your  bank's  fund  has  underperformed  in  literally  every  shown  time  period.  Mind  you,  the  vanguard  fund  is  all  US  stocks  and  bonds  which  have  done  very  well  whereas  the  CIBC  fund  is  mostly  Canadian.  Looking  at  the  CIBC  top  10  holdings  does  seem  to  suggest  that  it's  (poorly)  actively  managed  instead  of  being  an  index  tracker  for  what  that's  worth.  Maybe  your  bank  offers  cheaper  transaction  costs  when  buying  their  own  funds  but  even  then  the  discount  would  have  to  be  pretty  big  to  make  up  for  the  underperformance.  Basically,  go  Vanguard  here.
544236	Basically,  no.    Selecting  an  actively  managed  fund  over  a  low-fee  index  fund  means  paying  for  the  opportunity  to  possibly  outperform  the  index  fund.  A  Random  Walk  Down  Wall  Street  by  Burton  Malkiel  argues  that  the  best  general  strategy  for  the  average  investor  is  to  select  the  index  fund  because  the  fee  savings  are  certain.  Assuming  a  random  walk  means  that  any  mutual  fund  may  outperform  the  index  in  some  years,  but  this  is  not  an  indication  that  it  will  overall.    Unless  you  have  special  information  about  the  effectiveness  of  the  bank  fund  management  (it's  run  by  the  next  Warren  Buffett),  you  are  better  off  in  the  index  fund.  And  even  Warren  Buffett  suggests  you  are  probably  better  off  in  the  index  fund:  This  year,  regarding  Wall  Street,  Buffett  wrote:  “When  trillions  of  dollars  are  managed  by  Wall  Streeters  charging  high  fees,  it  will  usually  be  the  managers  who  reap  outsized  profits,  not  the  clients.  Both  large  and  small  investors  should  stick  with  low-cost  index  funds.”
263784	I  personally  invest  in  4  different  ETFs.    I  have  $1000  to  invest  every  month.    To  save  on  transaction  costs,  I  invest  that  sum  in  only  one  ETF  each  month,  the  one  that  is  most  underweight  at  the  time.  For  example,  I  invest  in  XIC  (30%),  VTI  (30%),  VEA  (30%),  and  VWO  (10%).    One  month,  I'll  buy  XIC,  next  month  VTA,  next  month,  VEA,  then  XIC  again.    Eventually  I'll  buy  VWO  when  it's  $1000  underweight.    If  one  ETF  tanks,  I  may  buy  it  twice  in  a  row  to  reach  my  target  allocation,  or  if  it  shoots  up,  I  may  skip  buying  it  for  a  while.    My  actual  asset  allocation  never  ends  up  looking  exactly  like  the  target,  but  it  trends  towards  it.    And  I  only  pay  one  commission  a  month.  If  this  is  in  a  tax-sheltered  account  (main  TFSA  or  RRSP),  another  option  is  to  invest  in  no-load  index  mutual  funds  that  match  the  ETFs  each  month  (assuming  there's  no  commission  to  buy  them).    Once  they  reach  a  certain  amount,  sell  and  buy  the  equivalent  ETFs.    This  is  not  a  good  approach  in  a  non-registered  account  because  you  will  have  to  pay  tax  on  any  capital  gains  when  selling  the  mutual  funds.
48678	By  not  timing  the  market  and  being  a  passive  investor,  the  best  time  to  invest  is  the  moment  you  have  extra  money  (usually  when  wages  are  received).  The  market  trends  up.    $10  fee  on  $2000  represents  0.5%  transaction  cost,  which  is  borderline  prohibitive.    I  would  suggest  running  simulations,  but  I  suspect  that  1  month  is  the  best  because  average  historical  monthly  total  return  is  more  than  0.5%.
254910	Note,  the  main  trade  off  here  is  the  costs  of  holding  cash  rather  than  being  invested  for  a  few  months  vs  trading  costs  from  trading  every  month.    Let's  start  by  understanding  investing  every  month  vs  every  three  months.    First  compare  holding  cash  for  two  months  (at  ~0%  for  most  Canadians  right  now)  and  then  investing  on  the  third  month  vs  being  invested  in  a  single  stock  etf  (~5%  annually?).    At  those  rates  she  is  forgoing  equity  returns  of  around    These  costs  and  the  $10  for  one  big  trade  give  total  costs  of  $16+$8+$10=$34  dollars.      If  you  were  to  trade  every  month  instead  there  would  be  no  cost  for  not  being  invested  and  the  trading  costs  over  three  months  would  just  be  3*$10=$30.    So  in  this  case  it  would  be  better  to  trade  monthly  instead  of  every  three  months.  However,  I'm  guessing  you  don't  trade  all  $2000  into  a  single  etf.    The  more  etfs  you  trade  the  more  trading  more  infrequently  would  be  an  advantage.    You  can  redo  the  above  calculations  spliting  the  amount  across  more  etfs  and  including  the  added  trading  costs  to  get  a  feel  for  what  is  best.    You  can  also  rotate  as  @Jason  suggests  but  that  can  leave  you  unbalanced  temporarily  if  not  done  carefully.    A  second  option  would  be  to  find  a  discount  broker  that  allows  you  to  trade  the  etfs  you  are  interested  in  for  free.    This  is  not  always  possible  but  often  will  be  for  those  investing  in  index  funds.    For  instance  I  trade  every  month  and  have  no  brokerage  costs.  Dollar  cost  averaging  and  value  averaging  are  for  people  investing  a  single  large  amount  instead  of  regular  monthly  amounts.    Unless  the  initial  amount  is  much  much  larger  than  the  monthly  amounts  this  is  probably  not  worth  considering.  Edit:  Hopefully  the  above  edits  will  clarify  that  I  was  comparing  the  costs  (including  the  forgone  returns)  of  trading  every  3  months  vs  trading  every  month.
526422	The  question  is  asking  for  a  European  equivalent  of  the  so-called  "Couch  Potato"  portfolio.  "Couch  Potato"  portfolio  is  defined  by  the  two  URLs  provided  in  question  as,  Criteria  for  fund  composition  Fixed-income:  Regardless  of  country  or  supra-national  market,  the  fixed-income  fund  should  have  holdings  throughout  the  entire  length  of  the  yield  curve  (most  available  maturities),  as  well  as  being  a  mix  of  government,  municipal  (general  obligation),  corporate  and  high-yield  bonds.    Equity:  The  common  equity  position  should  be  in  one  equity  market  index  fund.  It  shouldn't  be  a  DAX-30  or  CAC-40  or  DJIA  type  fund.  Instead,  you  want  a  combination  of  growth  and  value  companies.  The  fund  should  have  as  many  holdings  as  possible,  while  avoiding  too  much  expense  due  to  transaction  costs.  You  can  determine  how  much  is  too  much  by  comparing  candidate  funds  with  those  that  are  only  investing  in  highly  liquid,  large  company  stocks.  Why  it  is  easier  for  U.S.  and  Canadian  couch  potatoes  It  will  be  easier  to  find  two  good  funds,  at  lower  cost,  if  one  is  investing  in  a  country  with  sizable  markets  and  its  own  currency.  That's  why  the  Couch  Potato  strategy  lends  itself  most  naturally  to  the  U.S.A,  Canada,  Japan  and  probably  Australia,  Brazil,  South  Korea  and  possibly  Mexico  too.  In  Europe,  pre-EU,  any  of  Germany,  France,  Spain,  Italy  or  the  Scandinavian  countries  would  probably  have  worked  well.  The  only  concern  would  be  (possibly)  higher  equity  transactions  costs  and  certainly  larger  fixed-income  buy-sell  spreads,  due  to  smaller  and  less  liquid  markets  other  than  Germany.  These  costs  would  be  experienced  by  the  portfolio  manager,  and  passed  on  to  you,  as  the  investor.  For  the  EU  couch  potato  Remember  the  criteria,  especially  part  2,  and  the  intent  as  described  by  the  Couch  Potato  name,  implying  extremely  passive  investing.  You  want  to  choose  two  funds  offered  by  very  stable,  reputable  fund  management  companies.  You  will  be  re-balancing  every  six  months  or  a  year,  only.  That  is  four  transactions  per  year,  maximum.  You  don't  need  a  lot  of  interaction  with  anyone,  but  you  DO  need  to  have  the  means  to  quickly  exit  both  sides  of  the  trade,  should  you  decide,  for  any  reason,  that  you  need  the  money  or  that  the  strategy  isn't  right  for  you.    I  would  not  choose  an  ETF  from  iShares  just  because  it  is  easy  to  do  online  transactions.  For  many  investors,  that  is  important!  Here,  you  don't  need  that  convenience.  Instead,  you  need  stability  and  an  index  fund  with  a  good  reputation.  You  should  try  to  choose  an  EU  based  fund  manager,  or  one  in  your  home  country,  as  you'll  be  more  likely  to  know  who  is  good  and  who  isn't.  Don't  use  Vanguard's  FTSE  ETF  or  the  equivalent,  as  there  will  probably  be  currency  and  foreign  tax  concerns,  and  possibly  forex  risk.  The  couch  potato  strategy  requires  an  emphasis  on  low  fees  with  high  quality  funds  and  brokers  (if  not  buying  directly  from  the  fund).  As  for  type  of  fund,  it  would  be  best  to  choose  a  fund  that  is  invested  in  mostly  or  only  EU  or  EEU  (European  Economic  Union)  stocks,  and  the  same  for  bonds.  That  will  help  minimize  your  transaction  costs  and  tax  liability,  while  allowing  for  the  sort  of  broad  diversity  that  helps  buy  and  hold  index  fund  investors.
